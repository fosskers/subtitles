1
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:14,248
I was orphaned at a young age
 and was never given a name.

2
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,350
People simply called me Nameless.

3
00:02:16,352 --> 00:02:19,487
With no family name to live up to,
  I devoted myself to the sword.

4
00:02:19,489 --> 00:02:23,642
I spent ten years perfecting
unique skills as a swordsman.

5
00:02:23,644 --> 00:02:26,145
The King of Qin has summoned me to court,

6
00:02:26,147 --> 00:02:29,481
for what I have accomplished
 has astonished the kingdom.

7
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:38,573
(Man gives forward command)

8
00:02:46,967 --> 00:02:48,900
(Man gives command to stop)

9
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:06,517
By order of his majesty, we
  have traveled overnight

10
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,486
to bring the warrior to see you,
      Prime Minister.

11
00:03:29,009 --> 00:03:33,411
Sky, Snow and Broken Sword.

12
00:03:33,413 --> 00:03:35,646
For ten years these three
   assassins from Zhao

13
00:03:35,648 --> 00:03:38,549
have repeatedly plotted
  to kill his majesty,

14
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:43,088
so he has not known a single
  peaceful night's sleep.

15
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,691
Today we discover that a hero
from our great kingdom of Qin

16
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:49,060
has single-handedly wiped out the enemy.

17
00:03:49,062 --> 00:03:53,698
From now on his majesty can once more
       sleep without fear!

18
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,768
(all) His majesty's courtiers
     congratulate him.

19
00:03:56,770 --> 00:04:01,089
Heaven has sent a great warrior
to vanquish the assassins!

20
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:17,355
By his majesty's command,
   summon the warrior!

21
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:57,428
(man) When you enter the palace, always
remain one hundred paces from the throne

22
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,132
or you will be killed without question.

23
00:05:00,134 --> 00:05:02,234
Please do not forget!

24
00:05:30,331 --> 00:05:32,364
(King of Qin) For ten years,

25
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:35,300
no one has approached within one hundred
        paces of the throne.

26
00:05:35,302 --> 00:05:38,937
- Do you know why?
- (Nameless) Assassins were everywhere.

27
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:42,874
Correct. As long as there are assassins,
     I cannot remove my armor.

28
00:05:42,876 --> 00:05:46,345
Now that you have rooted out
  this evil on our behalf,

29
00:05:46,347 --> 00:05:48,680
what do you desire as a reward?

30
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,783
To rid great Qin of its enemies
is my duty. I desire no reward.

31
00:05:51,785 --> 00:05:55,537
In accordance with Qin law,
you must be properly rewarded.

32
00:06:00,093 --> 00:06:04,128
Sky's silver spear

33
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:09,501
has wounded untold numbers
of our brave Qin warriors.

34
00:06:09,503 --> 00:06:11,069
Pronounce my edict!

35
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:14,372
By order of his majesty, he who
  vanquishes the assassin Sky

36
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:16,625
will be awarded 1000 pieces of gold
and authority over 1000 households.

37
00:06:16,627 --> 00:06:20,662
Advance within 20 paces of the throne
    and drink with his majesty!

38
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:39,664
According to my informants,
 you are a citizen of Qin.

39
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:42,450
Your humble servant Nameless,
Prefect of Lan Meng district.

40
00:06:42,452 --> 00:06:45,787
A mere local Prefect! With authority over
    no more than ten square miles!

41
00:06:45,789 --> 00:06:49,057
This is the lowest rank of
  office in our kingdom.

42
00:06:49,059 --> 00:06:53,311
What enabled you to overcome the
three deadly assassins from Zhao?

43
00:06:53,313 --> 00:06:55,330
I dealt with them one at a time.

44
00:06:55,332 --> 00:06:57,299
Tell me in detail.

45
00:06:57,301 --> 00:06:59,801
Perhaps your majesty has heard
     that Broken Sword

46
00:06:59,803 --> 00:07:02,788
- and Snow were lovers?
- Indeed I have.

47
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:06,158
And was your majesty aware that they had
not spoken to each other for three years?

48
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,643
Three years without words?
     Why was that?

49
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:12,380
Snow had spent one night
  with Sky as lovers.

50
00:07:12,382 --> 00:07:14,800
Broken Sword took this to heart.

51
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,469
Why have I not heard about this?

52
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:20,588
It took your servant much effort
   to uncover this secret.

53
00:07:22,476 --> 00:07:24,542
To create a rift between
 Snow and Broken Sword,

54
00:07:24,544 --> 00:07:26,478
I had first to dispose of Sky.

55
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,982
Mm. I am beginning to
fathom your strategy.

56
00:07:30,984 --> 00:07:32,700
Your Majesty is most perceptive.

57
00:07:32,702 --> 00:07:35,169
What did you use to defeat Sky?

58
00:07:35,171 --> 00:07:37,005
The sword.

59
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:44,129
(Nameless) Within Lan Meng it is my
responsibility to arrest criminals.

60
00:07:44,131 --> 00:07:47,499
On the fifth day of the sixth month
  Sky appeared in a chess house.

61
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:53,070
I had heard that he was a lover of chess
 and music, and was a frequent visitor.

62
00:08:11,024 --> 00:08:13,692
The seven elite guards from Qin Court...

63
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:16,862
We have been trailing you for days.

64
00:08:16,864 --> 00:08:18,546
You are under arrest!

65
00:08:18,548 --> 00:08:21,148
Reveal your weapon and identify yourself!

66
00:09:57,497 --> 00:09:59,681
(Nameless) Halt!

67
00:10:07,808 --> 00:10:10,775
The local Prefect. What can I do for you?

68
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:12,677
This region is under my control!

69
00:10:12,679 --> 00:10:14,212
And?

70
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:18,182
You are a wanted criminal!
 I am here to arrest you!

71
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:39,898
(Swords clanging)

72
00:11:53,947 --> 00:11:57,849
Sir, would you be kind enough
  to play us another tune?

73
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:11,562
(Starts playing)

74
00:12:22,943 --> 00:12:27,946
(Nameless) Martial arts and music
   share the same principles.

75
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:31,950
Both wrestle with complex chords
     and rare melodies.

76
00:12:31,952 --> 00:12:36,303
We stood facing each other
    for a long time

77
00:12:36,305 --> 00:12:38,472
neither of us made a move,

78
00:12:38,474 --> 00:12:42,927
while our combat unfolded in
  the depths of our minds.

79
00:15:31,464 --> 00:15:33,380
How swift your sword must be!

80
00:15:36,486 --> 00:15:40,354
I prided myself in knowing
 every corner of our land.

81
00:15:40,356 --> 00:15:42,656
Yet I was unaware that

82
00:15:42,658 --> 00:15:46,226
within the small district of Lan Meng
  there is such a talent like you.

83
00:15:50,850 --> 00:15:53,217
Broken Sword.

84
00:15:54,353 --> 00:15:56,386
Flying Snow.

85
00:15:56,388 --> 00:15:58,322
By edict of his Majesty:

86
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:02,193
the assassins Broken Sword and Flying Snow
   have always worked as partners.

87
00:16:02,195 --> 00:16:05,229
He who eliminates either one of them

88
00:16:05,231 --> 00:16:08,166
is awarded 10,000 pieces of gold and
  authority over 5,000 households.

89
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:12,336
Advance within ten paces and
  drink with his majesty!

90
00:16:21,514 --> 00:16:24,949
Three years ago Snow and Broken Sword
   stormed our palace together.

91
00:16:24,951 --> 00:16:30,120
3,000 soldiers were unable to resist them.

92
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:34,359
I have since had this great hall emptied,

93
00:16:34,361 --> 00:16:37,912
so there is nowhere to hide!

94
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,264
Are you saying that your sword was
  swifter than theirs combined?

95
00:16:40,266 --> 00:16:41,548
No.

96
00:16:44,537 --> 00:16:46,470
So how did you manage to overcome them?

97
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:58,850
I was disguised as a citizen of Zhao
 and went searching for them there.

98
00:16:58,852 --> 00:17:06,757
It was rumored they were hiding
in a small calligraphy school.

99
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,461
I arrived as your Majesty's
   troops approached.

100
00:17:10,463 --> 00:17:13,197
People fled in terror.

101
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:16,034
Only the students and their master remained.

102
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,270
Why have you come at such a time?

103
00:17:19,272 --> 00:17:21,472
Who are you?

104
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:24,242
I am from a small province in Zhao.

105
00:17:24,244 --> 00:17:28,262
My father's dying wish was to acquire
a scroll from your prestigious school.

106
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:33,066
I fear this may be the last day of our school.

107
00:17:33,068 --> 00:17:35,819
My honorable guest, whose
calligraphy do you seek?

108
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:37,955
Master Broken Sword's.

109
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:40,875
Broken Sword's power was
immediately apparent to me.

110
00:17:40,877 --> 00:17:44,812
Rumor had it that his martial arts skills
    were rooted in his calligraphy.

111
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:47,081
In order to discover the swordsman,

112
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:52,086
I had first to study the calligrapher.

113
00:17:52,088 --> 00:17:53,571
Which character do you seek?

114
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,073
"Sword."

115
00:17:58,111 --> 00:18:01,679
My honored guest is fond of swords?

116
00:18:01,681 --> 00:18:05,483
I am merely fulfilling my father's last wish.

117
00:18:14,294 --> 00:18:16,694
What dimension of scroll?

118
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,096
Eight feet.

119
00:18:18,098 --> 00:18:21,299
A scroll of that size requires red ink.

120
00:18:21,301 --> 00:18:25,519
Master wishes to borrow some
 red ink from the mistress.

121
00:18:29,742 --> 00:18:33,377
Master wishes to borrow some red ink.

122
00:18:39,119 --> 00:18:41,619
Has mistress heard my request?

123
00:18:41,621 --> 00:18:44,188
Master wishes to borrow some red ink.

124
00:18:46,459 --> 00:18:48,526
Tell him to come himself.

125
00:19:02,675 --> 00:19:05,192
Your student respectfully
 requests some red ink.

126
00:19:33,156 --> 00:19:38,292
Broken Sword had not even
  started on the scroll

127
00:19:38,294 --> 00:19:40,911
when your Majesty's troops
arrived at the city gates.

128
00:19:46,802 --> 00:19:48,836
(Man shouts out command)

129
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,907
(Man shouts out command)

130
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:28,876
Prepare!

131
00:20:49,498 --> 00:20:51,665
Draw!

132
00:20:53,286 --> 00:20:56,219
(Nameless) Your majesty's
army has never lost a war

133
00:20:56,221 --> 00:21:00,624
because they never underestimate their
 enemy. Their tactics are brilliant,

134
00:21:00,626 --> 00:21:04,511
and the archers are peerless
in their range and accuracy.

135
00:21:04,513 --> 00:21:10,267
Wherever they venture their
 reputation precedes them.

136
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:22,647
(Man gives command)

137
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:25,565
(Soldiers) Storm! Storm! Storm!

138
00:21:47,507 --> 00:21:49,923
(Students screaming)

139
00:22:08,361 --> 00:22:11,662
You must all remember

140
00:22:11,664 --> 00:22:14,365
the arrows of Qin may be powerful.

141
00:22:14,367 --> 00:22:18,369
They may penetrate our cities
  and destroy our kingdom.

142
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:21,422
But they can never annihilate
    our written words!

143
00:22:21,424 --> 00:22:23,757
Today

144
00:22:23,759 --> 00:22:28,579
you will all learn the
true spirit of our art.

145
00:22:28,581 --> 00:22:31,732
(Soldiers chanting)

146
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:58,375
Storm! Storm! Storm!

147
00:23:18,231 --> 00:23:20,998
The Zhao people, did they really not move?

148
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:23,234
People from Zhao are particularly
     strong in spirit.

149
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:24,635
You asked for the character "Sword."

150
00:23:24,637 --> 00:23:26,103
Why was it difficult to do?

151
00:23:26,105 --> 00:23:29,073
There are normally 19 ways
of writing this character.

152
00:23:29,075 --> 00:23:33,677
What I requested from Broken Sword
    was the 20th variation.

153
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,462
Calligraphy and swordplay

154
00:23:35,464 --> 00:23:38,098
both rely on merging the power of the wrist
     with the spirit in the heart.

155
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:42,169
This 20th variation would reveal
the essence of his swordsmanship.

156
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:45,639
To think that one character can
 be written 19 different ways!

157
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:50,243
How can people communicate when they
   do not understand each other?

158
00:23:50,245 --> 00:23:54,498
Once I have conquered the six Kingdoms and
 suppressed all other rebellious states,

159
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,619
I shall rid the country of
these hopeless confusions,

160
00:23:58,621 --> 00:24:02,155
keep one unified language for the whole land.
     Wouldn't that be something?

161
00:24:02,157 --> 00:24:04,475
Is your majesty not stopping after
   defeating the six Kingdoms?

162
00:24:04,477 --> 00:24:06,643
The six Kingdoms are nothing!

163
00:24:06,645 --> 00:24:09,446
I intend to lead our army to
 every corner of this land

164
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:12,566
until we have established a vast
    and powerful empire!

165
00:24:47,653 --> 00:24:49,854
You must be mistress Flying Snow.

166
00:24:49,856 --> 00:24:53,223
- Why are you leaving?
- I am going to fend off the arrows.

167
00:24:53,225 --> 00:24:55,726
You are not needed. Please retire.

168
00:24:55,728 --> 00:24:59,163
The archers of Qin are legendary.

169
00:24:59,165 --> 00:25:01,148
Mistress Snow may not be able
 to repel them on her own.

170
00:25:26,392 --> 00:25:29,326
Storm! Storm! Storm!

171
00:27:10,813 --> 00:27:12,913
(Mistress Snow) You were quite brilliant.

172
00:27:12,915 --> 00:27:15,198
Mistress Snow is far superior.

173
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,785
You have not come for the calligraphy.

174
00:27:18,787 --> 00:27:20,304
Who are you?

175
00:27:20,306 --> 00:27:25,241
I have brought something to show you.

176
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:27,711
Please meet me in the library at midnight.

177
00:27:35,537 --> 00:27:38,572
- Beautiful calligraphy.
- Beautiful swordplay.

178
00:27:38,574 --> 00:27:41,075
But you have not seen me use my sword.

179
00:27:41,077 --> 00:27:43,994
Without your sword this
scroll would not exist.

180
00:27:43,996 --> 00:27:46,229
Please meet me in the library at midnight.

181
00:27:46,231 --> 00:27:49,700
I have something to show you.

182
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:53,236
While several hundred thousand Qin troops

183
00:27:53,238 --> 00:27:57,041
were preparing for the next onslaught,

184
00:27:57,043 --> 00:27:59,376
I spent the night contemplating the scroll,

185
00:27:59,378 --> 00:28:03,263
hoping to discover the secret
behind Broken Sword's skills.

186
00:28:12,907 --> 00:28:16,543
You say this calligraphy contains
   the mystery of swordplay,

187
00:28:16,545 --> 00:28:21,148
but I cannot see anything unusual here.

188
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:24,351
The brush and the sword are
  fundamentally connected.

189
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:27,587
Their mystery is only revealed to those
   who can perceive the connection.

190
00:28:27,589 --> 00:28:30,974
- And you can?
- Not entirely.

191
00:28:30,976 --> 00:28:34,978
Then how were you able to
challenge the two of them?

192
00:28:45,925 --> 00:28:48,458
Sky fell by your sword?

193
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:51,895
Yes.

194
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:55,432
Who are you? Why have you come?

195
00:28:55,434 --> 00:29:00,737
- I am a citizen of Qin. I have a message from Sky.
- Speak.

196
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:05,108
Sky said he had always lived his life
  without burden or responsibility.

197
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:07,945
Only one person had ever touched his heart.

198
00:29:07,947 --> 00:29:10,513
- Who?
- Flying Snow.

199
00:29:21,693 --> 00:29:25,728
Sky said he was certain Snow
  would avenge his death.

200
00:29:34,923 --> 00:29:38,758
If you agree to a duel, meet me at
the Qin army encampment tomorrow.

201
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:14,287
(Ripping)

202
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:17,223
(Moaning)

203
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:28,518
(Giggling/heavy breathing)

204
00:31:43,385 --> 00:31:45,718
Leave now.

205
00:31:50,392 --> 00:31:52,959
Go on!

206
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:19,920
I know you saw us!

207
00:32:24,325 --> 00:32:27,627
I deliberately wanted you to see us!

208
00:32:29,031 --> 00:32:32,766
You are no longer in my heart!

209
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,525
Agh!

210
00:32:56,809 --> 00:32:59,909
(Moans)

211
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:07,677
We are both very foolish.

212
00:35:02,451 --> 00:35:05,318
I am not going to fight with you.

213
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:06,336
Please leave.

214
00:35:09,874 --> 00:35:13,176
I am going to kill you
and avenge my master!

215
00:35:13,178 --> 00:35:15,729
Yaaagh!

216
00:35:23,505 --> 00:35:26,289
Yaaagh!

217
00:35:26,291 --> 00:35:27,456
Yaaagh!

218
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:40,003
Yaaagh!

219
00:35:46,361 --> 00:35:48,261
Yaaagh!

220
00:35:53,652 --> 00:35:55,602
Yaaagh!

221
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,761
Yaa-aaagh!

222
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:15,505
Since you want to die, I shall assist you.

223
00:36:17,158 --> 00:36:18,674
Yaaagh!

224
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,996
Aah!

225
00:36:44,136 --> 00:36:47,404
(Wind whistles)

226
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:35,585
Yaaagh!

227
00:37:53,538 --> 00:37:55,288
(Sword tears)

228
00:38:08,954 --> 00:38:10,353
Yaaagh!

229
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:40,850
What are you laughing at?

230
00:38:40,852 --> 00:38:44,788
What you did last night was
   unbelievably stupid.

231
00:39:25,897 --> 00:39:30,099
(Nameless) When we fought, I could
  see that my plan had worked.

232
00:39:30,101 --> 00:39:33,235
She was emotional and agitated,
     unable to focus.

233
00:39:33,237 --> 00:39:36,005
I defeated her easily.

234
00:39:49,037 --> 00:39:53,005
Who would have thought that
  Broken Sword and Snow

235
00:39:53,007 --> 00:39:55,324
were so emotionally fragile?

236
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:58,845
(Fluttering)

237
00:40:12,577 --> 00:40:17,580
- You are saying that you won by setting
     them against each other?
- Yes.

238
00:40:17,582 --> 00:40:22,419
And the reason they became enemies
  was because they were jealous?

239
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:26,505
- Yes.
- Your story appears to make sense,

240
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:31,160
but in my opinion you have
underestimated one person.

241
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:33,129
Who?

242
00:40:33,131 --> 00:40:34,964
Me.

243
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:39,368
Would you like to know what kind
 of impression they made on me?

244
00:40:39,370 --> 00:40:43,923
Three years ago, I had once
 fought them face to face.

245
00:40:43,925 --> 00:40:48,060
I found them both honorable
    and exceptional,

246
00:40:48,062 --> 00:40:50,045
hardly the narrow-minded people you say.

247
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:53,283
That is why Snow and Sky
did not have an affair.

248
00:40:53,285 --> 00:40:55,251
Snow and Broken Sword were not enemies.

249
00:40:55,253 --> 00:40:58,053
In other words, your entire story is a lie!

250
00:41:01,293 --> 00:41:04,193
Only one thing was true.

251
00:41:06,097 --> 00:41:09,632
Sky must have known one of you.

252
00:41:09,634 --> 00:41:10,683
Which one?

253
00:41:10,685 --> 00:41:13,019
You.

254
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:18,858
I suspect you and Sky were allies.

255
00:41:18,860 --> 00:41:21,860
You were able to defeat him
  for one reason only.

256
00:41:21,862 --> 00:41:23,028
What reason?

257
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:29,085
He lost to you deliberately!

258
00:41:32,023 --> 00:41:35,758
(King of Qin) In order to assassinate me
   the two of you staged a fight,

259
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,495
using my guards as witnesses.

260
00:41:38,497 --> 00:41:40,864
Laying this trap was not difficult.

261
00:41:40,866 --> 00:41:45,735
The hard part was in persuading Sky
 to place his life in your hands.

262
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:49,172
Your sword may be swift, but
  not enough to defeat Sky.

263
00:41:49,174 --> 00:41:51,724
Yet he willingly fell under your blade.

264
00:41:51,726 --> 00:41:54,544
What courage, what gallantry!

265
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:57,880
So Sky became your first accomplice.

266
00:42:00,352 --> 00:42:05,187
Sky was a proud man, who regarded himself
     without equal in this land.

267
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:09,491
What made him think that you would
   succeed where he had failed?

268
00:42:10,745 --> 00:42:14,313
Unless, in order to assassinate me,

269
00:42:14,315 --> 00:42:17,466
you had spent the last ten years
    honing a unique skill,

270
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,686
a lethal maneuver that no one can counter?

271
00:42:30,064 --> 00:42:34,133
Having defeated Sky, you could already
 come within 20 paces of the throne.

272
00:42:34,135 --> 00:42:37,270
Why did you need Broken Sword
     and Snow as well?

273
00:42:37,272 --> 00:42:43,342
I suspect you have to be within ten paces
   of your target to be effective.

274
00:42:43,344 --> 00:42:50,049
So, you required one more accomplice
to help you advance another ten paces!

275
00:42:52,353 --> 00:42:56,855
I believe that even though Broken Sword
    and Snow had never met Sky,

276
00:42:56,857 --> 00:43:01,427
they understood at once why
he had agreed to your plan.

277
00:43:13,425 --> 00:43:17,276
How far am I from the bookshelves?

278
00:43:17,278 --> 00:43:20,563
- About ten paces.
- Good. Ten paces it is.

279
00:44:04,743 --> 00:44:09,178
I only need one of you to help me.
Please decide between yourselves.

280
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,714
Tomorrow morning, at the Qin army encampment.

281
00:44:24,145 --> 00:44:27,079
How swift his sword is!

282
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:28,514
Yes.

283
00:44:28,516 --> 00:44:31,517
Sky was one of the greatest
  warriors of our times.

284
00:44:31,519 --> 00:44:33,920
Yet he was willing to give
  his life to this man.

285
00:44:33,922 --> 00:44:38,324
That is why he has the ability
 to assassinate Qin's king.

286
00:44:40,762 --> 00:44:42,328
We must go tomorrow.

287
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:46,098
To go is to die.

288
00:44:48,336 --> 00:44:51,170
Then let us die together.

289
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,293
Agh!

290
00:45:52,283 --> 00:45:54,150
You are one step ahead of me.

291
00:45:57,138 --> 00:45:59,138
(Moans)

292
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:17,189
I fear I have inflicted too deep a wound.

293
00:46:17,191 --> 00:46:21,144
I should have been the one to go.

294
00:46:21,146 --> 00:46:23,846
I want you to go on living.

295
00:46:23,848 --> 00:46:27,984
If you died, how could I live?

296
00:46:27,986 --> 00:46:33,789
Promise me you will live
 well when I have gone.

297
00:46:41,883 --> 00:46:43,816
Say it!

298
00:46:54,962 --> 00:46:56,395
I will.

299
00:47:05,423 --> 00:47:08,390
Moon will soon be here
 to take care of you.

300
00:47:11,162 --> 00:47:13,245
I should go.

301
00:48:32,744 --> 00:48:34,576
(Man shouts out command)

302
00:48:44,672 --> 00:48:47,506
Your servant Nameless,
 Prefect of Lan Meng.

303
00:48:47,508 --> 00:48:51,110
I have come to Zhao to catch this assassin.
     Please let me fight her alone.

304
00:48:51,112 --> 00:48:53,478
This is a dangerous criminal
   wanted by his majesty.

305
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:56,281
Now that she has been found,
it is my duty to arrest her.

306
00:48:56,283 --> 00:49:00,485
I have a prior agreement with
the assassin to fight her alone.

307
00:49:00,487 --> 00:49:04,106
If I am unable to succeed,
please feel free to step in.

308
00:49:04,108 --> 00:49:06,024
Please grant me permission to proceed.

309
00:49:19,289 --> 00:49:21,389
(Wind howls)

310
00:49:48,052 --> 00:49:50,336
Unsheathe your sword!

311
00:50:18,899 --> 00:50:22,017
(Chanting)

312
00:50:23,287 --> 00:50:24,920
Make your move now!

313
00:50:24,922 --> 00:50:27,790
(Chanting)

314
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,695
I die willingly for our cause.
Please make your move!

315
00:50:34,982 --> 00:50:37,566
(Chanting continues)

316
00:51:30,922 --> 00:51:33,255
How swift your sword is!

317
00:51:42,232 --> 00:51:43,749
(Snow exhaling)

318
00:51:45,086 --> 00:51:47,202
(Wind whistles)

319
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:28,544
(Birds singing)

320
00:52:36,154 --> 00:52:40,156
(King of Qin) I suspect you had a battle
      with Broken Sword as well.

321
00:52:40,158 --> 00:52:42,158
Like the fight between you and Sky,

322
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:45,761
you and Broken Sword fought
in the depth of your minds.

323
00:52:45,763 --> 00:52:47,896
Except neither of you wanted
    to harm the other,

324
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:52,668
but were content to go through
   the honorable motions.

325
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:56,037
This was also a tribute to Snow.

326
00:52:56,039 --> 00:52:58,106
(Yelping)

327
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,417
(Gasps)

328
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:05,077
Master asked me to give you his sword.

329
00:56:08,899 --> 00:56:10,432
Why has he done this?

330
00:56:10,434 --> 00:56:14,203
Master and Snow will always be
 together in life or in death,

331
00:56:14,205 --> 00:56:17,706
and their swords will never be apart.

332
00:56:27,651 --> 00:56:32,887
Master asked me to give you his sword
  to help assassinate Qin's king.

333
00:57:03,954 --> 00:57:08,824
(King of Qin) Sky, Broken Sword and Snow
   gave themselves in different ways,

334
00:57:08,826 --> 00:57:10,792
in order that you could come
  within ten paces of me.

335
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:14,363
All three were willing to
entrust their lives to you.

336
00:57:14,365 --> 00:57:17,232
Surely one can ask no more of a friend.

337
00:57:17,234 --> 00:57:22,003
That is why you are the most
dangerous assassin of them all!

338
00:57:33,951 --> 00:57:35,651
How did your Majesty figure this out?

339
00:57:35,653 --> 00:57:39,387
The candle flames in front of me

340
00:57:39,389 --> 00:57:41,372
can sense your murderous intent.

341
00:57:46,697 --> 00:57:50,566
The three of them, and you,

342
00:57:50,568 --> 00:57:53,802
were all willing to die for your cause.

343
00:57:53,804 --> 00:57:56,204
I am ashamed to say I cannot
measure up to your courage!

344
00:57:56,206 --> 00:58:00,492
Your Majesty has seen through our plan.

345
00:58:00,494 --> 00:58:04,096
I have only just worked it out.

346
00:58:04,098 --> 00:58:07,882
Why else would I have allowed
   you to come this close?

347
00:58:09,987 --> 00:58:13,105
A man from Qin would never try
  to kill me. Who are you?

348
00:58:13,107 --> 00:58:16,040
I am a man of Zhao.

349
00:58:16,042 --> 00:58:18,776
My family was killed by the Qin army.

350
00:58:18,778 --> 00:58:22,013
Orphaned, I was taken in
by a family here in Qin.

351
00:58:22,015 --> 00:58:26,050
Ten years ago I discovered my real identity,
     and decided to assassinate you.

352
00:58:26,052 --> 00:58:29,738
So you are here on behalf of Zhao.

353
00:58:31,274 --> 00:58:34,108
I understand now.

354
00:58:34,110 --> 00:58:37,946
I presume you have perfected a lethal move?

355
00:58:37,948 --> 00:58:41,383
Just as your Majesty suggests,
 there is indeed such a move.

356
00:58:41,385 --> 00:58:44,720
- And what is it?
- Within ten paces I cannot fail.

357
00:58:44,722 --> 00:58:48,790
Within ten paces? I congratulate you!

358
00:58:48,792 --> 00:58:52,293
My guards are outside a hundred paces away,

359
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:55,864
while you are only ten paces from me.

360
00:58:55,866 --> 00:59:00,969
It would seem that I shall
 not escape my fate today.

361
00:59:08,145 --> 00:59:10,379
And yet you hesitate?

362
00:59:10,381 --> 00:59:14,048
Your majesty is most perceptive.

363
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:16,184
However,

364
00:59:16,186 --> 00:59:18,436
you have also underestimated somebody.

365
00:59:18,438 --> 00:59:21,873
- Who?
- Broken Sword.

366
00:59:29,116 --> 00:59:31,182
It was imperative that I proved to them,

367
00:59:31,184 --> 00:59:34,519
that my sword was not only swift,
    but perfectly accurate.

368
01:00:19,316 --> 01:00:23,018
Within ten paces I can strike
  with surgical precision.

369
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:27,239
The sword will enter and exit the body,
    avoiding all vital organs,

370
01:00:27,241 --> 01:00:28,957
so the wound is deep but not fatal.

371
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:33,411
I respectfully request one of you
  to take such a blow from me

372
01:00:33,413 --> 01:00:34,946
in order to deceive Qin's king.

373
01:00:37,084 --> 01:00:40,718
To take such a blow from you
  asks a great deal of us.

374
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:43,839
- How is Sky now?
- Almost fully recovered.

375
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:46,391
He certainly had faith in your skills.

376
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:50,896
The security around the king is
impenetrable. This is the only way.

377
01:00:50,898 --> 01:00:54,465
The imperial guards are not worth a mention.

378
01:00:54,467 --> 01:00:57,719
The King of Qin should have
  died three years ago.

379
01:00:57,721 --> 01:01:00,672
What happened?

380
01:01:00,674 --> 01:01:03,207
I did not go through with it.

381
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:10,198
The King of Qin must not be killed.

382
01:01:10,200 --> 01:01:12,701
- Broken Sword said that?
- Yes.

383
01:01:12,703 --> 01:01:15,403
- Why?
- I asked the same question.

384
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:16,938
- What was his answer?

385
01:01:16,940 --> 01:01:20,892
He was unwilling to explain on that day.

386
01:01:20,894 --> 01:01:23,428
Sky, Snow, Broken Sword.

387
01:01:23,430 --> 01:01:28,266
Of the three, only Broken Sword was my match.

388
01:01:28,268 --> 01:01:30,701
That was why...

389
01:01:30,703 --> 01:01:33,704
what he said next

390
01:01:33,706 --> 01:01:35,857
worried me greatly.

391
01:01:35,859 --> 01:01:39,311
As long as I am alive I shall prevent
  you from assassinating the king.

392
01:01:42,282 --> 01:01:45,884
I am willing to help you.

393
01:01:45,886 --> 01:01:50,454
Three years ago somebody wasted
    a golden opportunity.

394
01:01:50,456 --> 01:01:53,291
This time, we must not fail.

395
01:01:53,293 --> 01:01:57,112
Tomorrow morning, I shall meet
  you at the Qin encampment.

396
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:04,469
I would like to ask a favor.

397
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:07,322
Help me to fight him now.

398
01:02:17,651 --> 01:02:18,717
Master!

399
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:27,258
What are you waiting for?

400
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:31,596
Although I had agreed to help Snow,

401
01:02:31,598 --> 01:02:34,065
it did not seem honorable
 to attack Broken Sword.

402
01:02:34,067 --> 01:02:36,067
I found myself unable to make a move,

403
01:02:36,069 --> 01:02:39,070
although we both knew that

404
01:02:39,072 --> 01:02:43,341
if we did not stop Broken Sword, we
 would have no chance of success.

405
01:03:05,849 --> 01:03:07,599
Yaaagh!

406
01:04:26,012 --> 01:04:27,645
Aah!

407
01:04:32,302 --> 01:04:34,536
Moon, stop!

408
01:04:34,538 --> 01:04:37,305
You are no match for him! Let it go!

409
01:05:00,830 --> 01:05:04,014
I knew you would do this.

410
01:05:05,117 --> 01:05:07,269
Now you cannot stand in my way.

411
01:05:07,271 --> 01:05:10,321
Even wounded I can still stop you.

412
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:13,658
In that case I shall have to kill you.

413
01:05:19,549 --> 01:05:22,117
I worry I may have wounded him too deeply.

414
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:27,255
With mistress' medicine, Master
should be out of danger in a day.

415
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,457
Have you delivered the medicine yet?

416
01:05:29,459 --> 01:05:32,327
I tended Master's wound myself.

417
01:05:32,329 --> 01:05:37,515
After the duel today,take my sword
and follow the Qin army into court.

418
01:05:37,517 --> 01:05:38,750
I will.

419
01:05:38,752 --> 01:05:42,687
The Qin guards will not
  ill-treat a servant.

420
01:05:42,689 --> 01:05:47,025
If the assassination is successful,
    return with a red flag.

421
01:05:47,027 --> 01:05:49,493
If it fails, a yellow one.

422
01:05:49,495 --> 01:05:53,331
If mistress meets with misfortune at
 the duel, what would be the point?

423
01:05:56,536 --> 01:06:01,239
When I look down from heaven the red flag
    will bring a smile to my lips.

424
01:06:08,966 --> 01:06:11,632
(Yelping)

425
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:54,242
- (Broken Sword) How is Snow?
- She is recovering.

426
01:06:57,530 --> 01:06:59,714
I am here without her knowledge.

427
01:06:59,716 --> 01:07:02,734
You once said as long as you are
 here you would try to stop me.

428
01:07:02,736 --> 01:07:04,853
Abandon your plan to assassinate the king.

429
01:07:04,855 --> 01:07:06,454
Do you know I am from Zhao?

430
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:07,939
So am I.

431
01:07:07,941 --> 01:07:09,790
Does Qin intend to destroy Zhao?

432
01:07:09,792 --> 01:07:11,125
Yes.

433
01:07:11,127 --> 01:07:14,746
- Is the King of Qin an enemy of Zhao?
- Yes.

434
01:07:14,748 --> 01:07:18,315
Then whom do you speak for? How can
 you call yourself a man of Zhao?

435
01:07:22,221 --> 01:07:27,024
Snow asked me the same question once.

436
01:07:29,262 --> 01:07:36,134
The year we met I was a wanderer
  with no home to call my own.

437
01:07:36,136 --> 01:07:39,270
She was the daughter of the
 great general Zhao Zhen,

438
01:07:39,272 --> 01:07:41,939
who lost his life during
  a battle against Qin.

439
01:07:41,941 --> 01:07:44,608
Snow inherited his sword.

440
01:07:44,610 --> 01:07:51,316
She had vowed to avenge her father's
   death. I wanted to help her.

441
01:07:51,318 --> 01:07:54,652
Calligraphy and swordplay share
the same source and principles.

442
01:07:54,654 --> 01:07:56,855
So we practiced calligraphy every day,

443
01:07:56,857 --> 01:08:01,076
in the hope that it would refine
our skills, and increase our power.

444
01:08:01,078 --> 01:08:04,245
Snow knew I had been rootless
    since childhood,

445
01:08:04,247 --> 01:08:06,314
living nowhere and everywhere.

446
01:08:06,316 --> 01:08:09,684
She often said to me, once we had
 succeeded in killing the king,

447
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:11,419
she would take me back to her home.

448
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:15,840
She said no swords existed
 there, and no swordsmen.

449
01:08:15,842 --> 01:08:19,477
There would only be a man and a woman.

450
01:08:39,031 --> 01:08:41,783
The truth of calligraphy has
 to be intuitively grasped.

451
01:08:41,785 --> 01:08:44,118
It is the same with swordplay.

452
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:46,721
Both seek to return to
a state of simplicity

453
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:50,191
Gradually, I began to understand.

454
01:08:55,281 --> 01:08:58,215
Three years ago, I reached
 the peak of my training.

455
01:08:58,217 --> 01:09:00,485
Snow felt it was time to
attempt the assassination.

456
01:09:00,487 --> 01:09:03,620
Together we stormed the palace.

457
01:09:26,880 --> 01:09:29,246
(Both yelling)

458
01:13:04,496 --> 01:13:08,716
(Broken Sword) Snow asked me why did
  I not go through with our plan.

459
01:13:08,718 --> 01:13:11,218
I told her the King of Qin
   must not be killed.

460
01:13:11,220 --> 01:13:15,189
This was something I had come to realize
    through studying calligraphy.

461
01:13:15,191 --> 01:13:19,827
Because I spared the king,
Snow turned her back on me.

462
01:13:25,467 --> 01:13:28,385
- Please abort your plan.
- No.

463
01:13:28,387 --> 01:13:30,838
Was all your training motivated
   by hatred and revenge?

464
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:33,341
That's right.

465
01:13:33,343 --> 01:13:38,412
For ten years, I worked relentlessly
     without a moment's rest.

466
01:13:38,414 --> 01:13:40,214
What will it take to dissuade you?

467
01:13:40,216 --> 01:13:41,932
You will have to kill me.

468
01:13:41,934 --> 01:13:44,018
So you are determined to go ahead?

469
01:13:44,020 --> 01:13:45,786
Yes.

470
01:13:45,788 --> 01:13:50,975
In that case, I shall make
 you a gift of two words.

471
01:14:27,730 --> 01:14:30,531
These words reflect what is in my heart.

472
01:14:30,533 --> 01:14:31,966
Please think again.

473
01:14:40,944 --> 01:14:44,312
Moon, give my sword to the nameless hero.

474
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:47,998
Just as Snow and I will always be together,
    our swords will never be apart.

475
01:15:02,465 --> 01:15:04,531
Master Nameless,

476
01:15:04,533 --> 01:15:09,586
even though I am only a lowly servant,
   please permit me a few words.

477
01:15:09,588 --> 01:15:12,656
I have served my master since I was eight.

478
01:15:12,658 --> 01:15:18,062
From him I learnt the martial arts
 and how to live with principles.

479
01:15:18,064 --> 01:15:23,868
My master is never wrong.
What he wrote must be important.

480
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:29,356
Master Nameless, please consider
    his advice carefully.

481
01:15:42,037 --> 01:15:46,523
Which two words did Broken Sword write?

482
01:15:46,525 --> 01:15:48,175
天下 ("All under heaven")

483
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:50,194
天下

484
01:15:50,196 --> 01:15:53,897
Broken Sword said for years there
  has been continuous warfare,

485
01:15:53,899 --> 01:15:55,733
causing huge suffering to the people.

486
01:15:55,735 --> 01:15:59,904
Only your majesty has the power to
 bring peace by uniting our land.

487
01:16:01,424 --> 01:16:04,825
He hoped that for the sake
   of the greater good,

488
01:16:04,827 --> 01:16:07,194
I would abandon my plan to kill you.

489
01:16:07,196 --> 01:16:11,498
Broken Sword also said,
"One person's pain is nothing

490
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:14,735
when compared to the suffering of all."

491
01:16:14,737 --> 01:16:21,725
The conflict between Zhao and Qin is nothing
   when compared with peace for all.

492
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:29,766
Who would have thought an assassin
  would understand me the best!

493
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:39,093
Alone in my position, I have
 endured endless criticism,

494
01:16:39,095 --> 01:16:40,928
endless attempts on my life.

495
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,697
No one has ever grasped what
  I have been trying to do.

496
01:16:43,699 --> 01:16:49,569
Even my own court regards me as a tyrant.

497
01:16:52,474 --> 01:16:55,209
And yet, Broken Sword,
 a man I barely knew

498
01:16:55,211 --> 01:17:00,081
was able to see clearly

499
01:17:01,751 --> 01:17:05,318
what is truly in my heart.

500
01:17:16,365 --> 01:17:18,799
I want to know that

501
01:17:18,801 --> 01:17:22,152
without a sword, how do
you intend to kill me?

502
01:17:22,154 --> 01:17:24,839
By taking yours.

503
01:17:37,286 --> 01:17:42,189
For ten years this sword has
accompanied me to every battle.

504
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:45,325
To have been understood by
a man such as Broken Sword

505
01:17:45,327 --> 01:17:48,028
allows me to face death
without fear or regret.

506
01:17:50,032 --> 01:17:53,166
Let the good of our country

507
01:17:53,168 --> 01:17:55,669
guide your decision!

508
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,020
I have just come to a realization!

509
01:19:53,022 --> 01:19:56,556
This scroll by Broken Sword contains
  no secrets of his swordsmanship.

510
01:19:56,558 --> 01:19:59,593
What this reveals is his highest ideal.

511
01:19:59,595 --> 01:20:06,616
In the first stage, man and sword
   become one and each other.

512
01:20:06,618 --> 01:20:09,303
Here, even a blade of grass can
  be used as a lethal weapon.

513
01:20:09,305 --> 01:20:14,825
In the next stage, the sword resides
 not in the hand, but in the heart.

514
01:20:14,827 --> 01:20:17,211
Even without a weapon,

515
01:20:17,213 --> 01:20:20,180
the warrior can slay his enemy
   from a hundred paces.

516
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:22,483
But the ultimate ideal is

517
01:20:22,485 --> 01:20:27,204
when the sword disappears altogether.

518
01:20:27,206 --> 01:20:30,958
The warrior embraces all around him.

519
01:20:30,960 --> 01:20:33,726
The desire to kill no longer exists.

520
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,363
Only peace remains.

521
01:20:54,984 --> 01:20:56,916
(Clanging of sword)

522
01:21:01,523 --> 01:21:06,893
Your Majesty, I have now
 completed my mission.

523
01:21:09,098 --> 01:21:14,701
Because of my decision
 today many will die,

524
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:19,506
and your Majesty will go on living.

525
01:21:19,508 --> 01:21:23,543
A dead man begs you never to forget

526
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:27,347
the ultimate ideal for a warrior.

527
01:23:29,021 --> 01:23:30,421
Nameless came within
ten paces of the king.

528
01:23:30,423 --> 01:23:34,058
He could not have failed.

529
01:23:34,060 --> 01:23:36,527
There can be only one explanation.

530
01:23:36,529 --> 01:23:39,846
He must have given up willingly.

531
01:23:39,848 --> 01:23:42,165
What did you say to him?

532
01:23:42,167 --> 01:23:44,284
I wrote two words.

533
01:23:44,286 --> 01:23:46,052
Which two words?

534
01:23:46,054 --> 01:23:49,122
天下

535
01:23:50,859 --> 01:23:52,859
Is that all there is in your heart?

536
01:23:52,861 --> 01:23:54,795
There is also you.

537
01:23:54,797 --> 01:23:56,997
I don't believe you.

538
01:23:56,999 --> 01:23:58,548
How can I convince you?

539
01:24:06,142 --> 01:24:08,274
Draw your sword!

540
01:24:10,412 --> 01:24:13,397
You have killed Nameless, betrayed Sky,

541
01:24:13,399 --> 01:24:16,233
and destroyed Zhao. Draw your sword!

542
01:24:20,122 --> 01:24:25,492
When we first met, you asked
  me to draw my sword then.

543
01:24:28,714 --> 01:24:30,197
Is the sword the only answer?

544
01:24:30,199 --> 01:24:32,415
I just want you to draw your sword.

545
01:25:25,921 --> 01:25:28,221
Yaaagh!

546
01:25:39,968 --> 01:25:41,901
(Gasping)

547
01:25:55,551 --> 01:25:57,484
Why did you not defend yourself?

548
01:25:58,587 --> 01:26:00,537
So you would finally believe me.

549
01:26:08,346 --> 01:26:11,048
I have always wanted
to go home with you.

550
01:26:15,921 --> 01:26:17,887
That will not happen now.

551
01:26:22,660 --> 01:26:26,246
On your own, you must take
  good care of yourself.

552
01:26:38,059 --> 01:26:40,827
Why didn't you block my sword?

553
01:26:49,003 --> 01:26:51,454
Why didn't you block it?

554
01:27:01,233 --> 01:27:03,766
Why didn't you?

555
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,157
No more struggle.

556
01:28:23,966 --> 01:28:28,568
I shall take you home now...

557
01:28:28,570 --> 01:28:31,605
to our home.

558
01:28:47,656 --> 01:28:48,588
Agh!

559
01:29:03,288 --> 01:29:05,621
(Screams)

560
01:29:38,340 --> 01:29:42,476
Your Majesty, permission to execute?
     Permission to execute?

561
01:29:42,478 --> 01:29:44,978
Permission to execute?

562
01:29:44,980 --> 01:29:48,631
Your Majesty, permission to execute?
Your Majesty, permission to execute?

563
01:29:48,633 --> 01:29:50,066
Permission to execution?

564
01:29:55,724 --> 01:29:57,974
(Man shouts command)

565
01:30:09,554 --> 01:30:12,906
He conspired to assassinate.

566
01:30:12,908 --> 01:30:16,076
This man cannot be trusted!
  He tried to kill you!

567
01:30:16,078 --> 01:30:19,463
Do not spare him!

568
01:30:20,832 --> 01:30:22,916
This is the sacred law of Qin!

569
01:30:22,918 --> 01:30:29,356
If your Majesty is to unite the land,
this man has to be made an example of!

570
01:30:29,358 --> 01:30:34,261
Your Majesty, execute him!
Your Majesty, execute him!
Your Majesty, execute him!

571
01:30:37,065 --> 01:30:42,402
Your Majesty, execute him!
Your Majesty, execute him!
Your Majesty, execute him!

572
01:30:50,328 --> 01:30:51,845
(Soldiers chant)

573
01:32:12,894 --> 01:32:16,663
(Chanting)

574
01:32:20,535 --> 01:32:24,637
(Chanting continues)

575
01:32:28,226 --> 01:32:31,393
(Chanting continues)
