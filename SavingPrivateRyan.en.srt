1
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:43,917
Dad?

2
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:33,697
Clear the ramp! 30 seconds!
May God be with you!

3
00:05:33,867 --> 00:05:38,361
Port side and starboard side stick!
Move fast and clear those mortar holes!

4
00:05:39,072 --> 00:05:41,336
I want plenty of beach between men.

5
00:05:41,508 --> 00:05:45,172
Five men is a juicy opportunity.
One man is a waste of ammo.

6
00:05:45,345 --> 00:05:50,010
Keep the sand out of your weapons!
Keep those actions clear!

7
00:05:50,183 --> 00:05:51,514
I'll see you on the beach!

8
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:28,017
Clear the mortar hole!
Right and left!

9
00:06:42,602 --> 00:06:44,366
Over the side!

10
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,836
Port and starboard!

11
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,014
Thank yo...

12
00:10:20,053 --> 00:10:21,487
What now, sir?

13
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:27,923
I said,
"What the hell do we do now, sir?"

14
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:33,093
Captain Miller! Captain Miller!

15
00:10:34,134 --> 00:10:38,731
- Captain Miller!
- Sergeant Horvath!

16
00:10:38,905 --> 00:10:42,364
Move your men off the beach! Now!

17
00:10:42,542 --> 00:10:46,240
Okay, you guys, get on my ass!
Follow me!

18
00:10:46,412 --> 00:10:51,475
- Sirl What's the rallying point?
- Anywhere but here!

19
00:11:02,896 --> 00:11:07,129
- What now, sir?
- The seawall, move up to the seawall!

20
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,498
- Sir, I'm staying!
- Clear the beach to make way.

21
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,299
This is all we've got
between us and the Almighty.

22
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:19,412
Every inch of this beach
has been pre-sighted.

23
00:11:19,579 --> 00:11:22,378
You stay here, you're dead men!

24
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:46,831
Stay down, stay down!

25
00:11:51,344 --> 00:11:55,372
- What are you guys?
- 104th Medical Battalion, sir.

26
00:11:55,548 --> 00:11:59,712
- We're here to set up field operations.
- Get rid of that crap!

27
00:11:59,886 --> 00:12:03,220
Grab yourselves some weapons
and follow me.

28
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,725
- I'm hit!
- Briggs!

29
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,803
Medic!

30
00:12:19,973 --> 00:12:23,409
- I'm hit low! God!
- Medic!

31
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,135
Navy Beach Battalion, sir!

32
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:29,043
I've got to clear these obstacles.
Make holes for the tanks!

33
00:12:29,215 --> 00:12:32,207
- The armour is floundering at sea.
- Orders, sir!

34
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:34,786
Go somewhere else!
I'm clearing this one.

35
00:12:34,954 --> 00:12:36,217
Come on, Briggs!

36
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:43,958
Medic!

37
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,461
Medic!

38
00:13:30,176 --> 00:13:32,270
Come on, move!

39
00:13:53,733 --> 00:13:57,135
Shore party!
No armour has made it ashore.

40
00:13:57,303 --> 00:14:02,104
We've got no DD tanks on the beach.
Dog One is not open!

41
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,273
Who's in command here?

42
00:14:05,445 --> 00:14:07,277
You are, sir!

43
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:12,812
Sergeant Horvath?
Do you recognize where we are?

44
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:15,215
Where we're supposed to be,
but no one else is.

45
00:14:15,388 --> 00:14:18,756
Nobody's where
they're supposed to be!

46
00:14:18,925 --> 00:14:21,155
Shore party!

47
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:24,695
First wave ineffective!
We do not hold the beach.

48
00:14:24,864 --> 00:14:27,959
Say again, we do not hold the beach!

49
00:14:28,134 --> 00:14:33,300
We're mixed up! We've got people from
Fox, Able and George companies.

50
00:14:33,473 --> 00:14:38,001
Plus, we got some Navy demo guys
and a beachmaster.

51
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:41,739
Shore party, Shore party!

52
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:50,417
CAT-F, CAT-F, CA...

53
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,851
- Reiben here.
- Seen anybody else?

54
00:14:56,028 --> 00:14:58,554
- Jackson, but that's it.
- Mellish here!

55
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,860
Caparzo! We've got DeForest
back there with Wade!

56
00:15:02,101 --> 00:15:07,596
D.'s hurt so bad he's sprung a hundred
leaks! Wade says he's used up!

57
00:15:07,774 --> 00:15:12,803
- Move on to somebody you can help.
- Let go, he's a battalion surgeon!

58
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:19,176
- Get his attention!
- Wade!

59
00:15:19,352 --> 00:15:22,219
- Wade!
- Wade!

60
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:26,825
Wade, don't do it!
It's too risky, too risky, Doc!

61
00:15:26,993 --> 00:15:29,223
Get your ass back here!

62
00:15:29,395 --> 00:15:31,227
Get him off the beach.

63
00:15:31,397 --> 00:15:35,061
I've got it! We've stopped the bleeding!

64
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:37,665
Fuck!

65
00:15:37,837 --> 00:15:41,501
Just give us a fucking chance,
you son of a bitch!

66
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,143
- Wade, come on!
- You son of a fucking cocksucker!

67
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:48,144
Wade, it's Mellish. Wade!

68
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,306
Let's move! We found Miller!
Let's move!

69
00:15:51,484 --> 00:15:53,009
Fuck it!

70
00:15:53,186 --> 00:15:55,712
Get down, get down!

71
00:16:00,693 --> 00:16:03,719
This is all?
This is all that's made it?

72
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:08,163
We got scattered pretty bad.
There's bound to be more of us.

73
00:16:08,334 --> 00:16:09,859
It's not enough.

74
00:16:10,036 --> 00:16:13,131
Dog One exit.
It's the cut to the right, or was it left?

75
00:16:13,306 --> 00:16:17,470
No. Vierville is to the left.
This is Dog One.

76
00:16:17,643 --> 00:16:23,138
They're killing us and we don't have
a fucking chance! That ain't fair!

77
00:16:23,316 --> 00:16:27,617
- Gather weapons and ammo!
- Gather weapons and ammo!

78
00:16:39,832 --> 00:16:42,563
Reiben! Where's your BAR?

79
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:45,227
Bottom of the Channel.
The bitch tried to drown me.

80
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,270
Find a replacement.

81
00:16:49,709 --> 00:16:52,406
Bi Bangalores!
ing out some bangalores!

82
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:57,414
- Engineers coming!
- Grenades, give me grenades!

83
00:17:00,286 --> 00:17:04,052
Bangalores up the line!
Bangalores up the line!

84
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:08,922
Heads up! Bangers coming your way!
Come on, come on!

85
00:17:09,095 --> 00:17:12,360
- Jackson here, sir!
- Reiben back, sir.

86
00:17:12,532 --> 00:17:14,899
Oh, my God!

87
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:18,503
Mortars incoming!

88
00:17:18,671 --> 00:17:21,038
One more, give me one more!

89
00:17:26,279 --> 00:17:29,044
Oh, my God, it hurts!
I'm going to die!

90
00:17:29,215 --> 00:17:32,549
Oh, my God! Jesus!
Oh, my God!

91
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,585
Come on, put it in. Keep it moving.

92
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:37,450
We've got it.

93
00:17:37,623 --> 00:17:40,490
Jesus! Lucky bastard.

94
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,691
Move it! Keep it moving!

95
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:52,597
You're not going to die. You're fine.
Just don't look at it. Don't look at it!

96
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:56,504
Bangalores! Clear the shingle!

97
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:59,145
- Fire in the hole!
- Fire in the hole!

98
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:01,178
Fire in the hole!

99
00:18:03,049 --> 00:18:05,074
Fire in the hole!

100
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:18,158
We're in business! Defilade!
Other side of the hole!

101
00:18:28,674 --> 00:18:31,234
Give him some morphine.

102
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,310
That's it, let's go.

103
00:18:37,016 --> 00:18:39,314
Inspected, morphine.

104
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:43,912
Routine.

105
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:12,509
Son of a bitch! Get in there.

106
00:19:12,685 --> 00:19:15,746
- Fuck, I can't move!
- Mellish, give me your bayonet.

107
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,015
Sarge.

108
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:41,240
Two MG-42s, two mortars.
Add 20, left 30.

109
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:48,386
There's defilade, but it's a good firing
position if we can land the armour.

110
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,546
We've got to get this draw open!

111
00:19:51,724 --> 00:19:56,719
Reiben, Mellish! Let's get in the war!
Take cover and put fire on that crew.

112
00:19:56,896 --> 00:20:01,129
Davis, DeBemnardo, Young, Valk!
Get ready!

113
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,267
Covering fire!

114
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,067
Go, go, go!

115
00:20:23,489 --> 00:20:25,617
I's a goddam firing squad.

116
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:28,624
It's the only way
we can get everybody out of here.

117
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:33,095
Short, Payton, McDonald, Parkes!
You're next!

118
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,700
Why not just
hand out blindfolds, Captain?

119
00:20:35,868 --> 00:20:40,135
All we can do here is die!
Covering fire!

120
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,709
Go, go, go!

121
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:48,442
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Go, goddammit!

122
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:03,428
- Jackson.
- Sir.

123
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:08,661
That impact crater should give you
defilade from the machine gun position.

124
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,930
Get in there and give me some
fire discipline. Wait for my command.

125
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:20,404
Gol

126
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,156
If your mother saw you do that,
she'd be very upset.

127
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,057
I thought you were my mother.

128
00:21:37,229 --> 00:21:39,926
Be not Thou far from me, O Lord.

129
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:49,801
Oh, my God. I am heartily sorry
for having offended Thee.

130
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:54,776
I detest my sins for having offended
Thee, O Lord. Listen to me, Lord.

131
00:22:00,986 --> 00:22:05,116
All my strength!
Haste Thee to help me.

132
00:22:20,439 --> 00:22:23,875
Dog One exit, right here!

133
00:22:24,043 --> 00:22:25,568
We're in business!

134
00:23:10,055 --> 00:23:11,682
- Reiben.
- Go, Sarge!

135
00:23:11,857 --> 00:23:13,518
Reiben!

136
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:43,919
Come on, Doyle!

137
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:47,123
Sarge!

138
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:54,990
Flame! Doyle, do it!

139
00:23:59,571 --> 00:24:02,131
Don't shoot! Let them burn!

140
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:20,752
On the right!

141
00:24:24,229 --> 00:24:26,596
I'l give you "comrade",
you son of a bitch!

142
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:30,633
Look out! Turn around, turn around.

143
00:24:51,790 --> 00:24:53,849
Flush them out!

144
00:24:57,496 --> 00:25:01,899
Cease fire, cease fire!
Cut it out, cut it out!

145
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:03,535
Cease fire!

146
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:08,265
Sugar Cane, Sugar Charlie Three.
Say again, Dog One is open.

147
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:12,968
Send in the dozers.
I'm waiting here to tie in my flanks.

148
00:25:13,145 --> 00:25:14,579
What?

149
00:25:17,783 --> 00:25:21,913
What? I'm sorry,
I can't understand what you're saying!

150
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,421
What did he say, what did he say?

151
00:25:31,597 --> 00:25:34,589
Look, I washed for supper!

152
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:40,262
Who's got a bazooka, goddammit?

153
00:25:47,212 --> 00:25:51,479
Hey, Fish.
Look at this, a Hitler Youth knife.

154
00:25:53,185 --> 00:25:55,882
And now it's a Shabbat
challah cutter, right?

155
00:26:06,131 --> 00:26:08,122
Keep it moving!

156
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:10,721
That's quite a view.

157
00:27:10,896 --> 00:27:12,990
Yes, itis.

158
00:27:14,233 --> 00:27:16,201
Quite a view.

159
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:55,526
"Dear Mr Brian Boyd. No doubt by now
you have received full information" -

160
00:28:55,701 --> 00:28:57,032
- "about the untimely death
of your son."

161
00:28:57,202 --> 00:28:59,899
"No words can ever
relieve your grief."

162
00:29:00,072 --> 00:29:02,700
"Our outfit has felt his loss greatly..."
"He was a fine soldier" -

163
00:29:02,941 --> 00:29:05,933
- "and believed strongly in
what we were doing..."

164
00:29:06,111 --> 00:29:09,103
"We were involved in one of the
most important operations of the war."

165
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:11,807
"Al was the one
who held us all together."

166
00:29:11,984 --> 00:29:13,611
"He was the first to volunteer."

167
00:29:13,785 --> 00:29:16,846
"We passed a road
where over 4,000 troops had passed."

168
00:29:17,022 --> 00:29:22,051
"Your husband served in a unit
whose duty is to place itself beyond..."

169
00:29:22,227 --> 00:29:25,128
"..which we all cherish
and hold dear..."

170
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:28,927
"The loss of Lee and others like him
is a distinct blow to the regiment.”

171
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:32,036
"We understand your
desire to learn about" -

172
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:35,230
- "the circumstances
leading to his death."

173
00:30:27,426 --> 00:30:30,418
Colonel, I've got something
you should know about.

174
00:30:32,431 --> 00:30:35,526
These two men died in Normandy.

175
00:30:35,701 --> 00:30:39,831
- This one at Omaha Beach.
-"Sean Ryan."

176
00:30:40,906 --> 00:30:45,036
- This man at Utah.
- "Peter Ryan."

177
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:52,014
This man was killed last week
in New Guinea.

178
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:57,522
"Daniel Ryan."

179
00:30:58,156 --> 00:31:00,124
They are brothers.

180
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:05,389
This afternoon their mother
is going to get all three telegrams.

181
00:31:08,467 --> 00:31:12,768
There's also a fourth brother who
parachuted in with 101st Airborne -

182
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:16,272
- the night before the invasion.
He is somewhere in Normandy.

183
00:31:16,441 --> 00:31:18,842
- Is he alive?
- We don't know.

184
00:31:22,748 --> 00:31:24,682
Come with me.

185
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:11,185
Goddammit.

186
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,849
All four were in the same company
in the 29th Division -

187
00:33:15,026 --> 00:33:17,723
- but we split them up after the Sullivan
brothers died on the Juneau.

188
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:21,093
Any contact with
the fourth son, James?

189
00:33:21,266 --> 00:33:26,636
No. He was dropped 15 miles inland
near Neuville, behind German lines.

190
00:33:26,805 --> 00:33:31,902
Mac, there is no way
you can know where he was dropped.

191
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:36,036
First report from Ike's people at
SHAEF said the 101st is scattered.

192
00:33:36,214 --> 00:33:38,376
There are misdrops
all over Normandy.

193
00:33:38,550 --> 00:33:42,851
Assuming Private Ryan even survived
the jump, he could be anywhere.

194
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:45,149
In fact, he's probably K.LA.

195
00:33:45,323 --> 00:33:48,850
And frankly, if we go sending
some sort of rescue mission, -

196
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,895
- flat-hatting throughout German
reinforcements along our advance, -

197
00:33:53,064 --> 00:33:55,999
- they're going to be KIA, too.

198
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,684
I have a letter here...

199
00:34:21,526 --> 00:34:27,590
written a long time ago fo a
Mrs Bixby in Boston. So bear with me.

200
00:34:30,368 --> 00:34:31,597
"Dear Madam."

201
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,933
"I have been shown in the files of
the War Department a statement” -

202
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,906
- "of the Adjutant General
of Massachusetts" -

203
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:42,672
- "that you are the mother of five..."

204
00:34:45,083 --> 00:34:49,145
"..sons who have died gloriously
on the field of battle."

205
00:34:51,489 --> 00:34:56,222
"I feel how weak and fruitless
must be any words of mine" -

206
00:34:56,394 --> 00:34:59,921
- "that would attempt to
beguile you from the grief" -

207
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:03,398
- "of a loss so overwhelming..."

208
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:09,302
"..but I can't refrain from tendering
the consolation that may be found" -

209
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:14,173
- "in the thanks of
the republic they died to save."

210
00:35:17,916 --> 00:35:22,410
"May our Heavenly Father assuage
the anguish of your bereavement" -

211
00:35:22,587 --> 00:35:27,821
- "and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved and lost" -

212
00:35:27,993 --> 00:35:31,725
- "and the solemn pride that must be
yours to have laid such a sacrifice” -

213
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:37,562
- "upon the altar of freedom.
Yours very sincerely and respectfully,” -

214
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:39,966
- "Abraham Lincoln."

215
00:35:58,723 --> 00:36:04,992
That boy is alive. We are going to
send somebody to find him.

216
00:36:05,163 --> 00:36:09,191
And we are going to get him
the hell out of there.

217
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:25,910
The Quartermaster's up the beach
a way. Look for a blown-up bunker.

218
00:36:26,084 --> 00:36:29,349
- Miller, Charlie Company.
- Go on in, Captain.

219
00:36:29,521 --> 00:36:32,547
If we don't off-load
the Shermans by 0600 -

220
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:37,628
- we'll have a division stuck at Carentan
with its pants around its ankles.

221
00:36:37,796 --> 00:36:40,094
Well, you let me know of it.

222
00:36:40,265 --> 00:36:43,565
Let Charlie Company hold at Vierville
‘til we can get the armour there.

223
00:36:43,735 --> 00:36:45,396
Runner!

224
00:36:51,443 --> 00:36:55,107
Airborne was supposed to win
an open door for us, but misdropped, -

225
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:58,147
- and scattered all their sticks into
the wind. What's your situation?

226
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:01,411
Yes, sir... Sector Four is secure.

227
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:08,549
We took out towed 88s
here, here and here.

228
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,526
They got four Shermans
and some deuce-and-a-halves.

229
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,666
These two minefields
are actually one big one.

230
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:18,736
We went up the middle of it, but it
turned into a mixed high-density field.

231
00:37:18,903 --> 00:37:22,032
A little bit of everything;
Sprengmine 44s, Schumne 42s, -

232
00:37:22,207 --> 00:37:27,577
- pot mines, A-200s, the little wooden
bastard the detectors don't pick up.

233
00:37:27,746 --> 00:37:33,310
Here, they placed big mushrooms,
Teller mine 43s, I guess for our tanks, -

234
00:37:33,485 --> 00:37:36,785
- from here right up to the edge
of the village, right here.

235
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:39,014
We marked them
and called the engineers.

236
00:37:39,190 --> 00:37:42,717
- Resistance?
- We had higher support expectations.

237
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:47,263
There was a company without artillery.
Wehrmacht. 346th Infantry.

238
00:37:47,432 --> 00:37:50,595
Von Lucke Kampfgruppe.
We ended up with 23 prisoners.

239
00:37:50,769 --> 00:37:53,261
We turned them over to MPs
from the 29th.

240
00:37:56,541 --> 00:37:59,306
What about our casualties?

241
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:06,543
Well, the figure is...
We're 35 dead, times two wounded.

242
00:38:06,718 --> 00:38:10,712
They just didn't want to
give up those 88s.

243
00:38:11,790 --> 00:38:14,521
It was a tough assignment.
That was why you got it.

244
00:38:14,692 --> 00:38:17,093
Yes, sir.

245
00:38:17,262 --> 00:38:19,230
John...

246
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:24,435
- I've got another one for you.
- Yes, sir.

247
00:38:24,602 --> 00:38:26,798
Its straight from the top.

248
00:38:31,943 --> 00:38:37,404
I wish. You and I are taking a squad
to Neuville on a PR mission.

249
00:38:37,582 --> 00:38:39,676
Oh, are you leading a squad?

250
00:38:39,851 --> 00:38:44,152
A private in the 101st lost three
brothers and he's got a ticket home.

251
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,518
- Why Neuville?
- They think he's there.

252
00:38:46,691 --> 00:38:49,626
Part of all those Airborne misdrops.

253
00:38:49,794 --> 00:38:53,924
It won't be easy finding one soldier
in the middle of this goddam war.

254
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:56,157
Like finding a needle
in a stack of needles.

255
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,859
What about the company?

256
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:01,199
We take the pick of the litter,
the rest goes to Baker.

257
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:05,468
Jesus Christ!
They took away your company?

258
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:09,773
It wasn't mine, it was the Army's.
So they told me, anyway.

259
00:39:09,948 --> 00:39:13,782
Get me Reiben on BAR, Jackson,
Wade, Beasley and Caparzo.

260
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:17,013
- Beasley's dead.
- Alright, Mellish then.

261
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,055
- Do have a guy who speaks French?
- Not that I know of.

262
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:24,493
- What about Talbot?
- This morning.

263
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:27,757
I'm going to
try and dig up another interpreter.

264
00:39:27,932 --> 00:39:30,993
Assemble at the battalion
motor pool on the beach.

265
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:33,638
- What are we going to do?
- Listen up. What?

266
00:39:33,805 --> 00:39:37,605
Go home wrapped in the American
flag with a hunk of cheese in your ass.

267
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,006
- I thought you liked it in the ass.
- What?

268
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:43,614
Attention!

269
00:39:43,781 --> 00:39:46,409
As you were. I'm looking for
Corporal Timothy Upham.

270
00:39:46,584 --> 00:39:48,609
Yes, I'm Upham.

271
00:39:48,786 --> 00:39:50,982
- Do you speak French and German?
- Yes, sir.

272
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:53,180
- How's your accent?
- Slight one in French.

273
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,486
- My German's clean.
- Very good.

274
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:59,392
You've been re-assigned to me.
Grab your gear, we're going to Neuville.

275
00:39:59,564 --> 00:40:03,023
- When was this updated?
- As of 8:30 this morning.

276
00:40:03,201 --> 00:40:06,432
This is the 12th SS Panzer. These are
the two axes advancing south.

277
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:11,633
- There are Germans in Neuville.
- I understand, Corporal.

278
00:40:11,809 --> 00:40:15,507
- There are a lot of Germans in Neuville.
- You've got a problem with that?

279
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:19,207
Please consider that I've never been
in combat. I make maps and translate.

280
00:40:19,384 --> 00:40:22,615
I need someone who speaks
French and German.

281
00:40:22,787 --> 00:40:26,917
- My two guys were killed.
- I haven't held a weapon since training.

282
00:40:27,091 --> 00:40:29,560
Did you fire the weapon
in Basic training?

283
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:33,186
- Yes, sir.
- Well, then get your gear.

284
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:36,764
Sir, may I bring...

285
00:40:40,939 --> 00:40:43,203
May I bring my typewriter, sir?

286
00:40:48,613 --> 00:40:50,411
Yes, sir.

287
00:40:53,084 --> 00:40:54,882
Thank you very much.

288
00:40:55,053 --> 00:40:57,181
- Is that a souvenir?
- No, sir.

289
00:40:57,355 --> 00:40:59,153
Take your time.

290
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,489
You should look on
the bright side of things, Corporal.

291
00:41:06,664 --> 00:41:10,862
- Yes.
- For one thing, you don't need those.

292
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:15,131
- You'll need that.
- Yes. I'll need this, not that.

293
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:13,558
- Hey!
- Hey!

294
00:42:13,731 --> 00:42:15,995
You want your head blown off?

295
00:42:16,167 --> 00:42:21,071
Don't touch me with those rat claws
again. Get the fuck back in formation!

296
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:25,075
I was just wondering
where you're from.

297
00:42:30,882 --> 00:42:33,681
- Caparzo, is it?
- Drop dead, Corporal.

298
00:42:33,851 --> 00:42:35,080
Gotcha.

299
00:42:35,253 --> 00:42:38,917
Every time you salute the Captain,
you make him a target for the Germans.

300
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:41,024
- I'm sorry.
- Do us a favour. Don't do it.

301
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:43,854
Especially when
I'm standing next to him. Capisci?

302
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:47,157
- Capisco.
about?
what's your book
- Corporal,

303
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:48,662
- Watch your rifle.
- Sorry.

304
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:53,794
It's about the brotherhood that
develops between soldiers during war.

305
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:57,635
Brotherhood? What do you know
about brotherhood?

306
00:42:57,809 --> 00:42:59,868
Get a load of this guy, Fish.

307
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:02,638
Why don't you ask the Captain
where he's from?

308
00:43:02,814 --> 00:43:06,250
Ask the Captain. He'll tell you
everything you want to know about him.

309
00:43:07,752 --> 00:43:09,686
Explain the maths of this to me.

310
00:43:09,854 --> 00:43:13,813
Where is the sense in risking the lives
of the eight of us to save one guy?

311
00:43:13,991 --> 00:43:16,961
20 degrees.
Anybody wants to answer that?

312
00:43:17,128 --> 00:43:20,257
Reiben, think about
the poor bastard's mother.

313
00:43:20,431 --> 00:43:22,593
Hey, Doc, I've got a mother.

314
00:43:22,767 --> 00:43:25,134
You've got a mother,
Sarge has got a mother.

315
00:43:25,303 --> 00:43:28,830
Shit, I bet
even the Captain's got a mother.

316
00:43:29,006 --> 00:43:31,805
Maybe not the Captain,
but the rest of us.

317
00:43:31,976 --> 00:43:34,308
"Theirs is not to reason why
their's is but to do and die"

318
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:38,814
is that supposed to mean, Corporal?

319
00:43:38,983 --> 00:43:40,348
We're all supposed to die?

320
00:43:40,518 --> 00:43:44,216
- Upham's talking about our duty.
- Yes, sir.

321
00:43:44,388 --> 00:43:46,186
We all have orders to follow.

322
00:43:48,826 --> 00:43:52,763
- Yes, sir. Thank you.
- Even if the mission is "FUBAR"?

323
00:43:52,930 --> 00:43:55,456
Especially if the mission is "FUBAR".

324
00:43:56,100 --> 00:43:59,866
- What's "FUBAR"?
- It's German.

325
00:44:00,037 --> 00:44:02,199
Never heard of that...

326
00:44:02,373 --> 00:44:06,537
Sir, I have an opinion on this matter.

327
00:44:06,711 --> 00:44:09,442
By all means,
share it with the squad.

328
00:44:09,614 --> 00:44:11,878
From my way of thinking, -

329
00:44:12,049 --> 00:44:16,850
- this mission is a misallocation
of valuable military resources.

330
00:44:17,021 --> 00:44:18,887
Yeah? Go on.

331
00:44:19,056 --> 00:44:24,688
It seems to me that God
made me a fine instrument of warfare.

332
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:28,730
Reiben, pay attention. Now, this is
the way to gripe. Continue, Jackson.

333
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:34,361
If He was to put me and this sniper rifle
anywhere up to and including -

334
00:44:34,539 --> 00:44:37,770
- one mile of Adolf Hitler
with a clear line of sight, sir...

335
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:41,207
Pack your bags, fellas,
the war is over. Amen.

336
00:44:41,379 --> 00:44:43,643
That's brilliant, bumpkin.

337
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,681
What about you, Captain?
You don't gripe at all?

338
00:44:46,851 --> 00:44:50,151
I don't gripe to you. I'm a captain.
There's a chain of command.

339
00:44:50,321 --> 00:44:52,153
Gripe always go up.

340
00:44:52,323 --> 00:44:57,159
You gripe to me, I gripe to
my superior officers, and so on.

341
00:44:57,328 --> 00:45:01,231
I don't gripe in front of you.
You should know that as a Ranger.

342
00:45:01,399 --> 00:45:06,098
I'm sorry, but let's say that you weren't
a captain or that I was a major.

343
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:08,034
What would you say?

344
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:12,143
In that case, I'd say,
"This is an excellent mission" -

345
00:45:12,310 --> 00:45:16,770
- "with a valuable objective
worthy of my best efforts."

346
00:45:16,948 --> 00:45:22,546
"Moreover, I feel heartfelt sorrow
for the mother of Private Ryan" -

347
00:45:22,720 --> 00:45:28,022
- "and I'll lay down my life and those of
my men, especially yours, Reiben," -

348
00:45:28,192 --> 00:45:29,717
- "to ease her suffering."

349
00:45:31,062 --> 00:45:33,463
- He's good.
- I love him.

350
00:45:43,874 --> 00:45:45,706
Fine!

351
00:46:26,917 --> 00:46:30,080
- Thunder!
- Flash!

352
00:46:30,254 --> 00:46:34,088
Upham, over there.
Reiben, you four go.

353
00:46:42,967 --> 00:46:44,867
Go, go, go, go!

354
00:46:50,408 --> 00:46:53,378
- You are a sight for sore eyes.
- Sergeant Hill, our reliefs showed up.

355
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:57,674
- How many are you?
- Eight. We're not your relief. Sorry.

356
00:46:57,848 --> 00:47:01,148
- What do you mean, sir?
- We're here for a Private Ryan.

357
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:03,788
-Who?
- Ryan? What for?

358
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:07,286
- Is he here?
- Maybe on the other side of the town.

359
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,984
It's hard to get to. The Germans
punched a hole in our centre.

360
00:47:10,161 --> 00:47:13,131
They cut us right in two.
What's his name, again?

361
00:47:13,297 --> 00:47:16,426
Ryan, James Ryan.
He dropped in with the 101st.

362
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:19,661
- Goldman, get me a runner!
- Runner!

363
00:47:19,837 --> 00:47:21,771
Come on!

364
00:47:25,443 --> 00:47:27,878
Jonesy, make a hole up there!

365
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:32,483
We got stopped by fire
from the eastward.

366
00:47:32,650 --> 00:47:36,314
The Germans have been reinforcing
two regiments all day.

367
00:47:36,487 --> 00:47:38,581
It's been quiet for 45 minutes.

368
00:47:38,756 --> 00:47:41,225
The Germans concentrate
their fire westward.

369
00:47:41,392 --> 00:47:44,726
- Who's that on the loudspeaker?
- Dagwood Duesseldorf.

370
00:47:44,895 --> 00:47:49,423
Our friendly
neighbourhood morale officer.

371
00:47:49,600 --> 00:47:52,900
"The Statue of Liberty is kaput.”

372
00:47:53,070 --> 00:47:55,471
That's disconcerting.

373
00:47:59,910 --> 00:48:04,177
Your father was circumcised
by my rabbi, you prick!

374
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,044
Cover!

375
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:17,655
Gol

376
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:43,516
- You sadistic fucking animals!
- Get down.

377
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:46,588
They know we're not in direct contact.
They'll single out the runners.

378
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,350
Why do they shoot them up?

379
00:48:48,526 --> 00:48:52,121
As long as his lungs are working, he
carries the message. We'd do the same.

380
00:48:52,296 --> 00:48:55,857
- No, we wouldn't!
- Wade! Get them ready to travel.

381
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:57,899
- Boyd!
- Come on!

382
00:48:58,068 --> 00:49:00,765
Try again! Let Captain Hamill
know we're coming.

383
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:03,236
What's the rest of Neuville like?

384
00:49:03,407 --> 00:49:07,241
The next block's got
two-storey buildings. A lot of windows.

385
00:49:07,411 --> 00:49:09,505
There's a square with good cover.

386
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:12,115
Show me.
Sarge, hold right here!

387
00:49:12,283 --> 00:49:13,751
Yes, sir!

388
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,549
Stay out of this enfilade
and use the buildings.

389
00:49:20,724 --> 00:49:23,694
Try a left hook. Shoot and scoot.
Two of yours, two of mine.

390
00:49:23,861 --> 00:49:26,387
Hastings, Goldman! Up front!

391
00:49:27,498 --> 00:49:30,195
- Reiben, Caparzo.
- They're still jamming us.

392
00:49:30,367 --> 00:49:33,462
Short runs, high and low at the corners.
It's going to be tight.

393
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:36,038
Be prepared for close contact. Go.

394
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,699
Upham!
You stay with Sergeant Horvath.

395
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:42,938
Stay here! I'll wear him like
underwear, Captain. You stay with me.

396
00:49:51,555 --> 00:49:54,024
Past the end of the block
are the gates of the square.

397
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:56,182
- Good.
- Alright.

398
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:05,298
Reiben, where's the Captain from?

399
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:09,235
- If you figure it out, you'll get a prize.
- 300 bucks, last I heard.

400
00:50:09,406 --> 00:50:12,933
The company's got a pool.
Five bucks gets you in.

401
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:23,511
I's around this corner.
Defilade right up to those gates.

402
00:50:25,022 --> 00:50:27,354
Somebody must know
where he's from.

403
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:30,517
I've been with him since
Casserene Pass. I don't have a clue.

404
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:35,564
My ankles are killing me. I'll need
a wheelchair before the war is over.

405
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:40,034
That's it! Oh, my God!
That ankle is like an old woman.

406
00:50:40,204 --> 00:50:43,606
Like an old...
Oh, God!

407
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:48,140
Reiben. So you don't even know
where he went to school?

408
00:50:48,312 --> 00:50:52,579
He didn't go to school. They assembled
him at OCS out of dead Gls.

409
00:50:52,750 --> 00:50:56,118
Pay attention to detail. I know
where he's from and what he did -

410
00:50:56,287 --> 00:50:58,415
- because I pay attention to detail.

411
00:50:58,589 --> 00:51:01,889
Hey, Upham!
Careful you don't step in the bullshit.

412
00:51:07,398 --> 00:51:09,696
-Doit.
- Thunder!

413
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:12,427
Thunder, or we will fire on you!

414
00:51:12,603 --> 00:51:15,629
Mellish, Caparzo, come here!

415
00:51:22,413 --> 00:51:25,280
Tell them to show themselves.

416
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:39,858
Ask them where the Germans are.

417
00:51:44,368 --> 00:51:46,564
- What is he saying?
- Something about the children.

418
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,933
- Kids?
- He wants us to take them.

419
00:51:49,106 --> 00:51:50,870
No, no. We can't take the kids.

420
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:56,571
We can't take the kids!
No, no!

421
00:51:58,749 --> 00:52:01,741
- They think they'll be safe.
- They won't be safe with us!

422
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:05,712
Are you nuts? Listen to the Captain!

423
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:08,224
They think they'll be safe with us.

424
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:13,853
I's not safe anywhere.
Caparzo! Put that kid back!

425
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:18,569
- Caparzo, put the girl back!
- Its OK, it's OK.

426
00:52:18,736 --> 00:52:20,932
Give that kid back!

427
00:52:22,072 --> 00:52:25,838
- Upham, how do you say, "It's OK?"
- I can't. She reminds me of my niece.

428
00:52:26,010 --> 00:52:27,978
Get the kid back up there!

429
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:31,604
We should at least take her
to the next town.

430
00:52:31,782 --> 00:52:34,877
We're not here to do that,
we're here to follow orders!

431
00:52:35,052 --> 00:52:38,215
Sarge, take this goddam kid!

432
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:41,086
Cover, cover!

433
00:52:49,967 --> 00:52:51,901
Goddammit!
Where did that come from?

434
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,667
He was on the ground
before we heard the shot.

435
00:53:02,913 --> 00:53:04,904
That's where I'd be.

436
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:10,645
- I didn't see it.
- 450 yards, maybe a shade under.

437
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:14,621
I wouldn't venture out there, fellas.
This sniper's got talent!

438
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:24,167
Please don't cry. I'll take you back
to Mama and Papa. Please don't cry.

439
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:25,665
Come on.

440
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:29,567
Carpy!

441
00:53:40,984 --> 00:53:43,954
- Captain!
- Hold on, Caparzo.

442
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,879
Help me up. I can walk.

443
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,718
Caparzo, stay still!

444
00:54:00,571 --> 00:54:03,472
Two clicks. Left wind.

445
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:08,509
Fish!

446
00:54:15,819 --> 00:54:18,413
Captain, can you see him?
How is he?

447
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,717
Wade, you stay put.

448
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:23,087
Where is he shot, Captain?

449
00:54:24,795 --> 00:54:27,162
- Can you see him?
- You stay there!

450
00:54:27,331 --> 00:54:29,732
Damn it! Stay down!

451
00:54:29,900 --> 00:54:34,565
What's the matter with you? Am I
going to take care of you if you get hit?

452
00:54:34,738 --> 00:54:36,604
Fish, come over here!

453
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:40,404
Carpy, put your head down!
Why can't you put your head down?

454
00:54:48,919 --> 00:54:52,116
Oh, my God, I trust in Thee.

455
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:58,126
Let me not be ashamed.
Let not my enemies triumph over me.

456
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:11,605
Copy it.
Copy it and send it for me.

457
00:55:11,775 --> 00:55:14,369
You're going to
send it yourself. Put it down!

458
00:55:14,545 --> 00:55:16,536
- It's got blood on it!
- I seeit.

459
00:55:21,318 --> 00:55:26,051
It's... It's to my dad.
It's got blood on it, Fish.

460
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,818
We got him. Stay down.

461
00:56:05,662 --> 00:56:09,098
- How bad is it?
- Chest, maybe lung shot.

462
00:56:25,349 --> 00:56:27,784
Get that .30 up the street!

463
00:56:32,556 --> 00:56:35,116
- Detail!
- Clear, up!

464
00:56:35,292 --> 00:56:36,885
Clear, down!

465
00:56:51,775 --> 00:56:54,369
That's why we can't take children.

466
00:57:00,717 --> 00:57:04,210
Sergeant Horvath, do an ammo check.

467
00:57:04,388 --> 00:57:07,881
Upham, canteens. Fill them up.

468
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:10,388
- Sergeant Hill.
- Yes, sir.

469
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,793
Gather your men. We'll form up
at the northwest corner of the square.

470
00:57:14,965 --> 00:57:16,558
- Jackson.
- Sirl

471
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:21,899
Mellish. Check the tower,
hustle back here. Right now, go!

472
00:57:33,216 --> 00:57:35,150
Fuck Ryan!

473
00:57:45,462 --> 00:57:49,695
- Thunder!
- Flash! Come on in!

474
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:56,568
Hey, guys.
We're looking for Captain Hamill.

475
00:57:56,740 --> 00:57:59,573
- Down there, across the square.
- Across the square.

476
00:57:59,743 --> 00:58:01,939
Go easy. Watch for snipers.

477
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:05,145
Sit down.

478
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:23,961
Jimmy T. Go and find
Captain Hamill. Bring him here.

479
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:28,128
- What? Up there?
- How should I know? Go and look!

480
00:58:28,305 --> 00:58:30,103
Thank you, you moron.

481
00:58:31,742 --> 00:58:36,873
Alright. You guys just
flake out here for a while.

482
00:58:38,515 --> 00:58:42,145
Let me get this goddam hitchhiker
out of my boot.

483
00:58:52,329 --> 00:58:56,129
- Put your weapons down!
- Drop them now!

484
00:59:00,170 --> 00:59:02,002
I'l shoot you!

485
00:59:02,172 --> 00:59:03,606
Drop, drop ‘em!

486
00:59:06,743 --> 00:59:08,507
Put 'em down!

487
00:59:24,094 --> 00:59:25,721
Clear, up!

488
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,302
Shit, shit!

489
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,802
Clear, up!

490
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:37,940
Clear, down!

491
00:59:49,853 --> 00:59:51,321
Enough to make you old.

492
00:59:52,656 --> 00:59:53,885
Let's hope so.

493
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,834
- Hamill, Pathfinders 101st.
- Miller, 2nd Rangers.

494
01:00:08,004 --> 01:00:10,564
Thank you.

495
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:13,232
We're looking for a Private Ryan.
He's part of your outfit.

496
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,469
Any chance that you policed him up?

497
01:00:16,046 --> 01:00:21,007
- How was the road in?
- Scenic. We lost most of our ammo.

498
01:00:21,184 --> 01:00:23,175
Not to mention one of our men.

499
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:27,654
Lieutenant! Redeploy that bazooka
to the right side of the road.

500
01:00:27,824 --> 01:00:30,088
And get Ryan up here!

501
01:00:31,962 --> 01:00:36,832
Ryan! Ryan!
Front and centre! Ryan!

502
01:00:40,504 --> 01:00:42,768
Here comes our boy.

503
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:52,039
I told you he was an asshole.

504
01:00:54,084 --> 01:00:56,781
- Private Ryan reporting as ordered.
- At ease.

505
01:00:56,953 --> 01:01:00,753
Captain Miller, 2nd Rangers,
wants a word with you.

506
01:01:01,992 --> 01:01:04,188
This way.

507
01:01:04,361 --> 01:01:07,626
Alright. Take a knee.

508
01:01:16,640 --> 01:01:19,007
Private, I'm afraid
I have some bad news for you.

509
01:01:27,784 --> 01:01:31,880
Well, there isn't
any really easy way to say this, so...

510
01:01:33,757 --> 01:01:37,159
..s0 I'll just say it.
Your brothers are dead.

511
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:43,093
We have orders to come and get you...

512
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,325
..because you're going home.

513
01:01:59,416 --> 01:02:01,544
Oh, my God! My brothers are dead!

514
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:13,326
I was going to take them fishing
when we got home.

515
01:02:26,876 --> 01:02:31,109
I'm so sorry, James.
I can't tell you how much.

516
01:02:31,281 --> 01:02:36,720
- How did they die?
- They were killed in action.

517
01:02:38,755 --> 01:02:40,917
That can't be.

518
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,218
They can't be my brothers.
They're still in grammar school.

519
01:02:49,199 --> 01:02:52,601
- You're James Ryan?
- Yeah.

520
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:55,898
James Francis Ryan from lowa?

521
01:02:56,072 --> 01:02:59,508
James Frederick Ryan, Minnesota.

522
01:03:05,949 --> 01:03:10,011
- Does that mean my brothers are OK?
- Yeah, I'm sure they're fine.

523
01:03:10,186 --> 01:03:13,156
- Are you sure?
- We're looking for a different Ryan.

524
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:14,813
Its just a big foul-up.

525
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:19,425
How can you be sure? How do
you know that the foul-up isn't -

526
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:21,621
- that his brothers are OK, and...

527
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:23,892
- Lieutenant.
- I'm sorry for the trouble.

528
01:03:24,067 --> 01:03:29,267
I just wrote them a letter
before I left. I've got to get home.

529
01:03:29,439 --> 01:03:34,275
I've got to get home right now.
I want to go home.

530
01:03:34,911 --> 01:03:36,310
- Where is our Ryan?
- Don't know.

531
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:40,541
- Are you in touch with your CO?
- What unit's Ryan in?

532
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:44,711
- Baker Company, 506th.
- The guy with the broken foot's in 506th.

533
01:03:44,888 --> 01:03:47,380
- Charlie, I think.
- You think?

534
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:51,357
Man!

535
01:03:51,528 --> 01:03:54,020
- Where was your dropzone?
- Vierville.

536
01:03:54,197 --> 01:03:56,962
Vierville? How did you end up here?

537
01:03:57,133 --> 01:04:00,262
You got me, sir.
The C-47 took heavy fire.

538
01:04:00,437 --> 01:04:02,963
Pilot went crazy
turning every which way.

539
01:04:03,139 --> 01:04:07,303
We took more fire in the drop.
It got messy. I ended up here.

540
01:04:07,477 --> 01:04:10,606
I haven't seen anyone from my stick.
God knows where they are.

541
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:14,444
Did anybody from Baker Company
talk about where the dropzone was?

542
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:17,951
No, but they had the same
rallying point as us.

543
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:20,055
Show me.

544
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:26,420
My men are beat. We'll hold up here
for three hours and pull out after dark.

545
01:04:26,596 --> 01:04:29,327
Got anything left in this town,
like a three-star hotel?

546
01:04:29,499 --> 01:04:32,628
Something with clean sheets,
soft pillows and room service?

547
01:04:32,802 --> 01:04:36,261
- How about a nice, comfy church?
- We'll take that.

548
01:04:36,439 --> 01:04:39,272
What have you heard?
How is it all falling together?

549
01:04:39,442 --> 01:04:43,640
We got the beachhead secured, but
Monty's taking his time moving on Caen.

550
01:04:43,813 --> 01:04:47,875
- We can't pull out til he's ready, so...
- That guy's overrated.

551
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:51,578
- No argument here.
- You take Caen to take Saint-L6.

552
01:04:51,755 --> 01:04:55,385
- You gotta take St-L6 to take Valognes.
- Valognes, you've got Cherbourg.

553
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:59,051
- Cherbourg, you've got Paris.
- Paris, you've got Berlin.

554
01:04:59,229 --> 01:05:01,698
And then that big boat home.

555
01:05:04,934 --> 01:05:08,666
I could really use you around here,
but I understand what you're doing.

556
01:05:08,838 --> 01:05:13,002
- You do?
- I've got a couple of brothers myself.

557
01:05:13,176 --> 01:05:15,338
-Oh.
- Good luck.

558
01:05:15,512 --> 01:05:18,038
- Thank you.
- No, I mean it.

559
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:21,309
Find him. Get him home.

560
01:05:29,125 --> 01:05:31,253
What's with your hand?

561
01:05:32,495 --> 01:05:34,827
I don't know.

562
01:05:36,032 --> 01:05:39,002
It started in Portsmouth
when we went down for embarkation.

563
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:43,834
- It comes and goes.
- You have to find yourself a new job.

564
01:05:44,007 --> 01:05:46,669
This one doesn't seem to
agree with you any more.

565
01:05:52,582 --> 01:05:54,277
What?

566
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,523
- What?
- Nothing.

567
01:06:00,690 --> 01:06:03,455
What was the name
of that kid at Anzio?

568
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,652
The one who walked on his hands -

569
01:06:06,830 --> 01:06:09,629
- and was singing that song
about the man on the flying trapeze?

570
01:06:09,799 --> 01:06:12,632
- Vecchio.
- Vecchio!

571
01:06:18,274 --> 01:06:22,006
Yeah, Vecchio.
He was a goofy kid.

572
01:06:23,146 --> 01:06:28,482
I remember he used to pee a "Vv"
on everybody's jackets. For "Vecchio".

573
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:31,643
- For victory.
- Vecchio.

574
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:38,022
- He was so short.
- He was a midget, wasn't he?

575
01:06:38,194 --> 01:06:42,028
Yeah, how did he get to be a Ranger?

576
01:06:42,198 --> 01:06:44,826
He got shot in the foot once,
walking on his hands.

577
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:48,835
He could walk faster on his hands.

578
01:06:49,005 --> 01:06:51,906
He could run faster on his hands.

579
01:06:54,644 --> 01:06:58,342
Vecchio. Yeah.

580
01:07:00,016 --> 01:07:02,314
Caparzo.

581
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:13,762
You see, when you end up
killing one of your men, -

582
01:07:13,930 --> 01:07:18,663
- you tell yourself it happened
$0 you could save the lives of -

583
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:23,102
- two, three, or ten others.

584
01:07:24,307 --> 01:07:26,799
Maybe 100 others.

585
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:33,381
Do you know how many men
I've lost under my command?

586
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:35,848
- How many?
-94,

587
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:42,925
But that means I've saved the lives
of ten times that many, doesn't it?

588
01:07:43,960 --> 01:07:47,988
Maybe even 20, right?
20 times as many?

589
01:07:53,369 --> 01:07:56,600
And that's how simple it is.

590
01:07:56,773 --> 01:08:01,973
That's how you rationalise
making the choice -

591
01:08:02,145 --> 01:08:05,240
- between the mission and the men.

592
01:08:05,415 --> 01:08:08,316
Except that this time
the mission is a man.

593
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:14,615
This Ryan had better be worth it.

594
01:08:17,327 --> 01:08:20,058
He'd better go home
and cure some disease -

595
01:08:20,229 --> 01:08:24,427
- or invent a longer-lasting light-bulb
or something.

596
01:08:24,601 --> 01:08:29,061
For the truth is that I wouldn't trade
ten Ryans for one Vecchio or Caparzo.

597
01:08:29,238 --> 01:08:31,070
Amen.

598
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:36,670
- Look, there it goes again.
- Sir.

599
01:08:38,114 --> 01:08:39,741
Are you alright?

600
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:48,987
We'll move out in two hours.
Why don't you get some sleep?

601
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:52,985
- I don't know how he does it.
- What's that?

602
01:08:53,162 --> 01:08:55,722
Falls asleep like that. Look at him.

603
01:08:55,898 --> 01:08:58,890
The guy's lights-out
the minute his head hits the pack.

604
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:02,436
- Clear conscience.
- What's that saying?

605
01:09:02,605 --> 01:09:04,937
God's on our side,
who could be on theirs?

606
01:09:05,108 --> 01:09:08,100
"If God be for us,
who could be against us?"

607
01:09:08,277 --> 01:09:10,405
Yeah, what did I say?

608
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:14,778
The trick to falling asleep
is trying to stay awake.

609
01:09:14,951 --> 01:09:16,646
How is that, Wade?

610
01:09:16,819 --> 01:09:21,780
When my mother was an intern
she used to work through the night -

611
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:23,392
- and sleep through the day.

612
01:09:24,360 --> 01:09:27,728
The only time we talked
was when she'd get home.

613
01:09:27,897 --> 01:09:34,860
I used to lie in bed and stay awake
as long as I could, but it never worked -

614
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:39,373
- because the harder I tried
the faster I'd fall asleep.

615
01:09:39,542 --> 01:09:42,807
That wouldn't have mattered in
my house. Ma would've come home, -

616
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:48,145
- shook me awake, chatted me up "til
dawn. She was never too tired to talk.

617
01:09:48,317 --> 01:09:51,617
That's probably the only time
she could get a word in.

618
01:09:56,359 --> 01:09:59,989
Funny thing is, sometimes
she would come home early -

619
01:10:00,163 --> 01:10:02,564
-and I'd pretend to be asleep.

620
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:06,600
- Who, your mum?
- Yeah.

621
01:10:09,105 --> 01:10:12,541
She'd stand in the doorway
looking at me, -

622
01:10:12,709 --> 01:10:15,610
-and I would just keep my eyes shut.

623
01:10:17,714 --> 01:10:21,673
And I knew that she just wanted to
find out about my day, -

624
01:10:21,851 --> 01:10:28,348
- that she came home early
just to talk to me.

625
01:10:31,160 --> 01:10:35,256
And I still wouldn't move.
I'd still pretend to be asleep.

626
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,705
I don't know why I did that.

627
01:10:58,221 --> 01:11:01,680
We've only got a couple of hours.
Shut up and go to sleep.

628
01:11:10,600 --> 01:11:13,900
Captain? Sir?

629
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,132
Corporal.

630
01:11:21,711 --> 01:11:25,079
How are you doing? Are you alright?

631
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:28,411
Yeah, I think this is all good for me, sir.

632
01:11:29,886 --> 01:11:33,447
Really? How is that?

633
01:11:37,493 --> 01:11:41,896
"War educates the senses,
calls into action the will," -

634
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:45,261
- "perfects the phy rsical constitt tion," -

635
01:11:45,434 --> 01:11:49,200
- "brings men in such swift and
close collision in critical moments," -

636
01:11:49,372 --> 01:11:51,739
- "that man measures man."

637
01:11:51,908 --> 01:11:56,709
I guess that's Emerson's way
of finding the bright side.

638
01:11:56,879 --> 01:12:01,214
- You know Emerson, sir?
- I know some.

639
01:12:04,987 --> 01:12:09,356
So, where are you from, Captain?
What did you do before the war?

640
01:12:11,093 --> 01:12:13,152
What's the pool up to?

641
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:20,335
I think it's around 300, sir.

642
01:12:20,503 --> 01:12:25,168
When it gets up to 500, I'l give you
the answer and we'll split the money.

643
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:27,366
How about that?

644
01:12:27,543 --> 01:12:30,979
If that's the way you feel, I feel
it's my duty under your command -

645
01:12:31,147 --> 01:12:36,108
- to suggest that we wait
until it gets up to 1,000. I think it's...

646
01:12:37,253 --> 01:12:39,847
What if we don't live that long?

647
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:45,853
-5007
- 500 would be good, yes.

648
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:47,996
Yes, sir.

649
01:12:50,633 --> 01:12:53,762
- Get some sleep, Corporal.
- Yes, sir.

650
01:13:59,802 --> 01:14:02,032
Who's got sulfa powder?

651
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:08,874
Medic, my buddy's bleeding!
He needs a tourniquet.

652
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:10,103
- Wade.
- Yes, sir?

653
01:14:10,279 --> 01:14:12,543
- See what you can do.
- Yes, sir.

654
01:14:12,715 --> 01:14:15,844
Hold on, fellas.
It won't be much longer.

655
01:14:16,018 --> 01:14:18,419
How are we doing here?

656
01:14:18,587 --> 01:14:24,458
Alright. You're doing alright,
don't worry about it. The Doc's in town.

657
01:14:26,028 --> 01:14:29,862
Don't worry. The 29th Infantry's
breaking through. They'll be here soon.

658
01:14:30,032 --> 01:14:32,364
Has anybody got plasma?

659
01:14:32,535 --> 01:14:34,503
Hey, Captain!

660
01:14:34,670 --> 01:14:38,197
- Soldier, you want to fill me in?
- Yeah. Lieutenant De\Windt.

661
01:14:38,374 --> 01:14:42,174
96th Troop Carrier Squadron carrying
in 300th and 307th Glider Infantry.

662
01:14:42,345 --> 01:14:45,110
- This one was mine. I was the pilot.
- Private!

663
01:14:45,281 --> 01:14:46,578
-22 men dead.
- Take care of this one.

664
01:14:46,749 --> 01:14:49,548
I landed there without a scratch,
took my co-pilot's head right off.

665
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,483
Who are these people?

666
01:14:51,654 --> 01:14:55,887
The guys we came in with headed off
the first night. Haven't seen them since.

667
01:14:56,058 --> 01:14:59,995
In the meantime other guys keep
showing up. One, two, six at a time.

668
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,995
Then some officer will come along,
patch together a mixed unit, -

669
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,532
- and head off to make trouble.

670
01:15:05,701 --> 01:15:09,934
We're looking for a Private Ryan,
Baker Company, 506th of the 101st.

671
01:15:10,106 --> 01:15:12,302
You got me.
A lot of guys come in and out.

672
01:15:12,475 --> 01:15:15,740
Upham! Check out that squad.
See if Ryan's in it.

673
01:15:15,911 --> 01:15:17,675
Yes, sir.

674
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:24,214
Reiben! Smell that leg, right there.
Find out if it's south of cheese.

675
01:15:30,693 --> 01:15:32,752
What?

676
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:35,363
Hands over your head.

677
01:15:37,199 --> 01:15:39,099
Keep moving!

678
01:15:41,904 --> 01:15:43,702
I'm Jude, you know.

679
01:15:46,342 --> 01:15:50,142
I couldn't pry him out of there.
I need a winch.

680
01:15:50,312 --> 01:15:51,939
Yeah.

681
01:15:55,151 --> 01:15:57,415
- Stars.
- Yeah.

682
01:15:57,586 --> 01:16:02,046
Deputy Commander, 101st.

683
01:16:02,224 --> 01:16:06,991
Some genius had the great idea
of welding steel plates onto our deck -

684
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:09,564
- to keep the General safe
from ground fire, -

685
01:16:09,732 --> 01:16:13,896
- but they forgot to tell me until
just before we were getting airborne.

686
01:16:14,070 --> 01:16:17,631
That's like trying to
fly a freight train. OK?

687
01:16:17,807 --> 01:16:21,471
Gross overload.
Trim characteristics all shot to hell.

688
01:16:21,644 --> 01:16:24,545
I nearly broke both my arms
trying to keep her level.

689
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:29,048
When we released
I cut as hard as I could, -

690
01:16:29,218 --> 01:16:32,552
- trying to gain some altitude
and keep her from stalling.

691
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:37,625
We came down like a fucking meteor.
And this is how we ended up.

692
01:16:39,161 --> 01:16:42,461
The others stopped
easy enough, though.

693
01:16:42,631 --> 01:16:46,226
We were just
too damn heavy, you know?

694
01:16:46,402 --> 01:16:51,670
The grass was wet.
Downward slope and all.

695
01:16:51,841 --> 01:16:54,173
22 guys dead.

696
01:16:56,479 --> 01:17:00,438
- All that for a general?
- One man.

697
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:05,414
- There's a lot of that going around.
-"FUBAR."

698
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:08,280
-"FUBAR"
-"FUBAR."

699
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:13,020
-"FUBAR."
- You all got that right.

700
01:17:13,195 --> 01:17:15,926
I looked it up in a German dictionary.
"FUBAR"s not there.

701
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:18,658
Upham! There are
more paratroopers out there.

702
01:17:18,834 --> 01:17:21,201
Find out if one of them is Ryan.

703
01:17:21,370 --> 01:17:24,340
‘You might want to check this out, sir.

704
01:17:24,507 --> 01:17:28,034
Dog tags. More than
I really want to count, sir.

705
01:17:29,979 --> 01:17:32,971
I've covered a lot of bodies, sir.

706
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:37,882
- Jackson. Start going through those.
- Yes, sir.

707
01:17:38,921 --> 01:17:40,150
I'l help.

708
01:17:43,092 --> 01:17:47,620
- Do you think that little prick's in there?
- If he is, I'm going to find him.

709
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:50,561
- I bet that son of a bitch...
- I've got money saying he's still alive.

710
01:17:50,733 --> 01:17:54,567
- 10 bucks says I nail him first.
- Let's see what we've got in here.

711
01:17:54,737 --> 01:17:57,638
- You mugs don't stand a chance.
- Do you think he's in here?

712
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:00,468
- Just keep looking.
- Alright.

713
01:18:00,643 --> 01:18:05,877
"Gary lanico", "Ben Rubino", "Mike
Cesario"... All the Guineas are buying it.

714
01:18:06,048 --> 01:18:10,485
- Come on, it's not the right name!
- "Wee Willie Winkie". A buddy of yours.

715
01:18:11,253 --> 01:18:13,244
We've got to find this prick.

716
01:18:17,693 --> 01:18:19,491
Where's this son of a bitch?

717
01:18:19,662 --> 01:18:21,994
Don't mix them up.
Keep them in your pile.

718
01:18:22,164 --> 01:18:24,496
How am I supposed to know
who we've got?

719
01:18:24,667 --> 01:18:27,329
Why don't you just shut up, Reiben?

720
01:18:27,503 --> 01:18:31,770
- Everybody be friends.
- Cranky there, huh?

721
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:34,842
- I think I've got a winner.
- What are you talking about?

722
01:18:35,010 --> 01:18:37,274
- "Ryan."
- Ryan?

723
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:41,007
- Take a look at that, Mellis.
- You're really a genius.

724
01:18:41,183 --> 01:18:45,745
"R-I-E-N-N-E." That's "Rienne" and it's
French. Do you know what that means?

725
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:48,549
- It means "nothing".
- What beats three of a kind?

726
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:53,127
- 1 got shit here, all guys from New York.
- You're always bitching.

727
01:18:53,295 --> 01:18:55,263
- Do you need a hand?
- I've got a full house.

728
01:18:55,431 --> 01:18:58,457
I've got you beat. Straight flush.

729
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:01,934
You're looking at my cards.
You're cheating.

730
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:06,098
Fucking unreal, this guy.
Can you read that shit?

731
01:19:06,275 --> 01:19:10,872
- Jesus, look at this poor bastard!
- 1 guess they're not bulletproof.

732
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:12,309
1 guess not.

733
01:19:12,481 --> 01:19:17,043
- I don't like what's between his ears.
- It's like what's between your legs.

734
01:19:17,219 --> 01:19:20,678
- We've got to give him that.
- That's not bad for you, Jackson.

735
01:19:20,856 --> 01:19:23,723
- I've got three of a kind.
- What the hell are you doing?

736
01:19:23,892 --> 01:19:27,692
The whole goddam Airborne's
watching. These aren't poker chips.

737
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:30,389
- Alright.
- Put them back in there.

738
01:19:55,090 --> 01:19:56,751
He's not here.

739
01:20:01,263 --> 01:20:03,755
Maybe we should split into groups?

740
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:06,162
Just wander the woods
calling his name.

741
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:09,100
He's bound to hear us
sooner or later. Ryan!

742
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:12,866
That might be
a little hard to do, Captain.

743
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:19,846
Maybe the locals have seen him.
Ryan, James Ryan?

744
01:20:20,015 --> 01:20:23,713
Ryan! Anybody know Ryan,
101st Airborne? You know Ryan?

745
01:20:23,886 --> 01:20:28,824
Private James Ryan from lowa?
Anybody know a Ryan?

746
01:20:28,991 --> 01:20:32,484
- James Ryan!
- Hey, Joe!

747
01:20:32,661 --> 01:20:36,928
Doesn't Michaelson pal around with
a Ryan from C Company?

748
01:20:37,099 --> 01:20:40,399
- I think so.
- Bring him up.

749
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:52,009
- You know Private Ryan?
- You have to speak up...

750
01:20:52,181 --> 01:20:55,412
You have to speak up, sir!
My hearing is not so good!

751
01:20:55,584 --> 01:20:58,451
It comes and goes.
A grenade went off right by my head.

752
01:20:58,620 --> 01:21:03,148
- Got it. Do you know Private Ryan?
-Who?

753
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:06,852
- Private Ryan? James Ryan?
- Jimmy Ryan?

754
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,896
James. James Francis Ryan.

755
01:21:10,065 --> 01:21:13,091
No, no, no. James Francis Ryan.

756
01:21:13,268 --> 01:21:16,363
Give me a pencil.
Something to write on.

757
01:21:16,538 --> 01:21:18,097
Quick, a pencil!

758
01:21:20,342 --> 01:21:22,208
Here you are, a small one.

759
01:21:23,212 --> 01:21:28,082
Write this down:
"James Francis Ryan? lowa?"

760
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:32,084
"Do you know him?"
Read the message! Look!

761
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:38,523
- Yeah, of course I know him.
- Does he know where he is?

762
01:21:42,564 --> 01:21:45,864
Yeah, we missed our dropzone
by about 20 miles -

763
01:21:46,034 --> 01:21:49,265
- and ended up way over by
"Bumville" or some damn place.

764
01:21:49,438 --> 01:21:52,533
Him, me and a couple of others
were coming here to the rally point.

765
01:21:52,708 --> 01:21:58,374
We ran into a colonel who was
gathering up men to go to Ramelle.

766
01:21:58,547 --> 01:22:00,641
- Ramelle?
- To babysit a bridge.

767
01:22:00,816 --> 01:22:03,808
- That's the last I've seen of him.
- Great! Thank you!

768
01:22:03,986 --> 01:22:07,081
- Write "Thank you". Read. Thank you.
- You're welcome!

769
01:22:07,256 --> 01:22:09,020
Assemble on me.

770
01:22:10,993 --> 01:22:12,961
Thank you, Lieutenant.

771
01:22:15,597 --> 01:22:17,622
Ramelle.

772
01:22:18,567 --> 01:22:24,062
We're here. There. Ramelle is
on the Merderet River, right here.

773
01:22:24,239 --> 01:22:26,333
Just to the southwest of us.

774
01:22:26,508 --> 01:22:28,840
You know anything about that bridge?

775
01:22:29,011 --> 01:22:33,448
Yeah. The target
has always been Cherbourg.

776
01:22:33,615 --> 01:22:38,781
We can't push on Paris until we take a
deep water port and Rommel knows that.

777
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:43,482
He's going to try to get his armour across
the Merderet River anyway he can.

778
01:22:43,659 --> 01:22:48,529
That way he can hit us in the flank
when we make the turn for Cherbourg.

779
01:22:48,697 --> 01:22:54,466
That makes any village on the river
with a bridge solid gold real estate.

780
01:23:14,756 --> 01:23:16,121
Let's go.

781
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:27,260
Captain.

782
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,341
What the hell is that?

783
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:11,536
A radar site. It's got to be out of action.

784
01:24:11,713 --> 01:24:17,675
Looks like we've got something in
that sandbag bunker under the station.

785
01:24:17,853 --> 01:24:21,881
-Seeit?
- Yeah, that's my guess, too.

786
01:24:22,057 --> 01:24:26,961
- What is it?
- Machine gun, probably MG-42.

787
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:31,032
- Is that what got those guys?
- Maybe one of them is Ryan.

788
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:34,191
No, their patches are 82nd,
$0 your luck's not that good.

789
01:24:34,369 --> 01:24:39,136
I don't know how fast you are, but if
we detour this way quick and quiet, -

790
01:24:39,308 --> 01:24:41,037
- the Krauts will never even know
we were here.

791
01:24:42,644 --> 01:24:46,046
What I'm trying to say is
why don't we just go around the thing?

792
01:24:46,214 --> 01:24:49,980
I hear what you're saying,
but we can't go around it.

793
01:24:51,420 --> 01:24:55,084
I'm with Reiben.
I mean, we left those 88s.

794
01:24:55,958 --> 01:25:01,795
For the Air Force. They're not going to
spend ordnance on one machine gun.

795
01:25:01,964 --> 01:25:03,261
Captain.

796
01:25:04,499 --> 01:25:09,403
We can skip it and still accomplish our
mission. This isn't our mission, right?

797
01:25:09,571 --> 01:25:11,801
Is that what you want to do, Mellish?

798
01:25:11,974 --> 01:25:14,500
Leave it here
so they can ambush another company?

799
01:25:14,676 --> 01:25:20,410
No, I'm simply saying it's seems
an unnecessary risk given our objective.

800
01:25:20,582 --> 01:25:23,051
Our objective is to win the war.

801
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:30,514
It's just that I don't have
a good feeling about this one.

802
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:37,020
When was the last time
you felt good about anything?

803
01:25:57,719 --> 01:26:00,780
Alright. Three runners
with suppressing fire.

804
01:26:00,956 --> 01:26:04,153
Mellish. You hook to the right,
I'll go up the middle.

805
01:26:04,326 --> 01:26:06,294
Who's going left?

806
01:26:12,501 --> 01:26:15,095
Who's going left?

807
01:26:18,573 --> 01:26:20,940
Il doit.

808
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:23,510
-Igo left.
- Alright.

809
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:27,081
Upham, switch off with Jackson
and you linger in the rear.

810
01:26:28,717 --> 01:26:32,585
We advance and keep pressure on him
‘til he has to change out his barrels.

811
01:26:34,389 --> 01:26:36,380
We should be able to hit them
from grenade range.

812
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:40,461
- Maybe I should go up the middle?
- The way you run? I don't think so.

813
01:26:40,629 --> 01:26:44,930
- Maybe I should go left, sir.
- Maybe you should shut up!

814
01:26:45,100 --> 01:26:48,001
Reiben, base of fire.

815
01:26:56,211 --> 01:26:58,942
Mags and clips
where you can reach them -

816
01:26:59,114 --> 01:27:01,879
- and extra grenades
for the base runners.

817
01:28:26,902 --> 01:28:29,803
- Hill's clear. Four down and dead!
- Upham!

818
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:33,601
Grab the gear and get up here!
We need water and extra dressing.

819
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:38,611
Get the morphine
out of the medical kit!

820
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:52,422
- Son of a bitch!
- Get some sulfa on there.

821
01:28:52,594 --> 01:28:54,756
- Move my legs up.
- I got them.

822
01:28:54,930 --> 01:28:56,625
- Pour sulfa.
- Listen to my voice.

823
01:28:56,798 --> 01:28:58,994
You're going to be alright, Doc.

824
01:29:00,635 --> 01:29:02,763
You're fine.
You're going on a hospital ship.

825
01:29:02,938 --> 01:29:05,635
- More sulfa!
- Move my legs up.

826
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:08,674
- Put my legs up.
- I've got them.

827
01:29:08,844 --> 01:29:10,812
- You're going to be OK.
- Its alright, Doc.

828
01:29:10,979 --> 01:29:13,949
- Upham, give me your canteen!
- Come on.

829
01:29:14,115 --> 01:29:18,382
- We're going to get you out of here.
- Put some pressure on it.

830
01:29:18,553 --> 01:29:20,749
- Am I shot? How does it look?
- Give him some morphine.

831
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:24,984
- How does it look?
- You're going to be OK.

832
01:29:25,160 --> 01:29:26,753
Here comes the morphine.

833
01:29:27,529 --> 01:29:30,464
Am I shot in the spine?

834
01:29:31,233 --> 01:29:33,565
- You're OK.
- Am I shot in the spine?

835
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:35,794
- Lift him up.
- Move him over.

836
01:29:35,971 --> 01:29:38,633
- Put some pressure on.
- Easy, easy.

837
01:29:42,344 --> 01:29:45,405
It's OK, Doc. It's alright.

838
01:29:45,580 --> 01:29:49,642
Wade, you've got an exit wound.
It's in the small of your back.

839
01:29:49,818 --> 01:29:53,254
- How big is the hole?
- I's about the size of an acorn.

840
01:29:53,421 --> 01:29:55,890
- It's fine.
- Put him back.

841
01:29:58,093 --> 01:30:02,223
Put some pressure on it.
Put some pressure on it.

842
01:30:02,397 --> 01:30:05,025
Put some pressure on it!

843
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:07,994
Put some more pressure on it.

844
01:30:09,638 --> 01:30:11,800
Is there anything bleeding
worse than the others?

845
01:30:11,973 --> 01:30:15,170
Yeah, right here.
Do you know what it is? Right here.

846
01:30:15,343 --> 01:30:18,836
- I'l put your hand on it.
- We got some pressure on there.

847
01:30:19,014 --> 01:30:20,880
That's the one.

848
01:30:21,049 --> 01:30:25,145
Oh, my God! My liver!
its my liver!

849
01:30:26,254 --> 01:30:28,586
Tell us what to do.
Tell us how to fix you.

850
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,419
What can we do?
Tell us what to do.

851
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:37,763
I could use a little morphine.

852
01:30:38,533 --> 01:30:41,093
More morphine, sir.

853
01:30:41,269 --> 01:30:44,261
OK. OK.

854
01:30:46,341 --> 01:30:49,743
- Sir? What?
- Give it to him.

855
01:30:51,379 --> 01:30:53,507
Give it to him.

856
01:30:57,185 --> 01:31:02,089
- I don't want to die!
- Here you go, Wade. Here it comes.

857
01:31:06,861 --> 01:31:08,693
Give him another one.

858
01:31:21,943 --> 01:31:25,607
I want to go home,
I want go home.

859
01:32:15,330 --> 01:32:17,492
Reiben, hold him!

860
01:32:37,719 --> 01:32:39,448
Not yet!

861
01:32:41,623 --> 01:32:44,649
First make him mark and cover
Wade's body for Grave Detail.

862
01:32:46,227 --> 01:32:49,390
Same thing for the paratroopers
down there.

863
01:32:49,564 --> 01:32:52,124
Strip that stuff off him.
Check him for intelligence.

864
01:32:52,300 --> 01:32:56,328
Ask this piece of shit if he shot Wade!
Ask him!

865
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:57,994
- Does it matter?
- It does!

866
01:33:01,609 --> 01:33:04,442
Shut up with that filthy pig Latin.

867
01:33:06,281 --> 01:33:09,307
Jackson, are you hit?

868
01:33:12,253 --> 01:33:13,550
It just skinned the arm.

869
01:33:13,721 --> 01:33:19,160
Get it cleaned and dressed.
You and Sarge watch the perimeter.

870
01:33:21,262 --> 01:33:25,392
- He says, "Please don't shoot."
- I don't care what he says, Upham.

871
01:33:26,668 --> 01:33:29,603
Sir? Sir, are you going to
let them kill him?

872
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:34,939
- This is not right, sir.
- You can help him with the bodies.

873
01:33:37,278 --> 01:33:39,406
What is happening?

874
01:35:29,524 --> 01:35:32,619
American.

875
01:35:32,794 --> 01:35:34,728
I like American.

876
01:35:42,070 --> 01:35:44,630
Steamboat Willie.

877
01:35:44,806 --> 01:35:49,209
- Steamboat Willie.
- Steamboat Willie. American.

878
01:36:00,455 --> 01:36:06,360
- He says he's not finished.
- That's what you think. Come on.

879
01:36:14,369 --> 01:36:18,203
Please! I like Americal

880
01:36:19,407 --> 01:36:21,432
Fancy schmancy! What a cinch!

881
01:36:21,609 --> 01:36:25,102
Go fly a kite!
Cat got your tongue! Cool beans!

882
01:36:28,783 --> 01:36:31,775
Betty Boop! What a dish.

883
01:36:31,953 --> 01:36:34,047
Betty Grable. Nice gams.

884
01:36:41,129 --> 01:36:43,928
1 say can you see

885
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:47,068
1 say can you see

886
01:36:47,235 --> 01:36:49,363
say...

887
01:36:56,244 --> 01:36:57,939
Fuck Hitler.

888
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:01,973
Fuck Hitler!

889
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:14,890
Sir, he says he's sorry about Wade.
He says he's sorry about Wade.

890
01:37:15,063 --> 01:37:16,724
Captain!

891
01:37:16,898 --> 01:37:20,459
Captain, this isn't right.
You know this.

892
01:37:20,635 --> 01:37:25,471
He's a prisoner. He surrendered.
He surrendered, sir!

893
01:37:35,850 --> 01:37:37,511
Tell him...

894
01:37:39,787 --> 01:37:44,691
..fo march 1,000 paces in that direction.
Then he can take off the blindfold.

895
01:37:44,859 --> 01:37:47,556
He turns himself in
to the first Allied patrol.

896
01:37:47,729 --> 01:37:49,356
Are you kidding? We're letting him go?

897
01:37:49,530 --> 01:37:53,262
He's a POW, Reiben.
We can't take him with us.

898
01:37:53,434 --> 01:37:58,065
- Our guys will pick him up.
- That was a close shave.

899
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:00,264
Lucky Strikes.

900
01:38:04,078 --> 01:38:06,274
Take me out to the ball game...

901
01:38:06,447 --> 01:38:12,181
Only if he doesn't get picked up by his
own and get thrown back into circulation.

902
01:38:13,688 --> 01:38:17,647
- Captain, you just let the enemy go.
- This is such bullshit.

903
01:38:17,825 --> 01:38:21,659
- You all got that right.
- Bullshit? This is bullshit?

904
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:24,423
Shooting a prisoner is OK?
It's against the rules!

905
01:38:24,599 --> 01:38:29,059
The goddam rules just walked off
with your new friend.

906
01:38:30,505 --> 01:38:33,907
But I guess that was
the decent thing to do, Captain?

907
01:38:41,516 --> 01:38:44,042
Get your gear. Let's go.

908
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:48,685
You heard him. Gear up.

909
01:38:49,724 --> 01:38:53,024
- The Captain just gave you an order.
- Yeah.

910
01:38:53,194 --> 01:38:56,960
Like the one he gave to take this
machine gun. That was a real doozy.

911
01:38:57,131 --> 01:38:58,621
You're out of line!

912
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:01,770
That was one hell of a call
coming to take this nest, -

913
01:39:01,936 --> 01:39:04,906
- but what the hell, we only lost
one of our guys going for it.

914
01:39:05,072 --> 01:39:08,372
I hope Mama Ryan's really happy
knowing that little Jimmy's life -

915
01:39:08,543 --> 01:39:10,944
- was more important
than two of our guys!

916
01:39:11,112 --> 01:39:14,173
But then, we haven't found them,
have we?

917
01:39:15,883 --> 01:39:17,351
- Hey...
- Get off mel!

918
01:39:17,518 --> 01:39:19,919
Reiben, get up.

919
01:39:21,155 --> 01:39:24,557
Gear up. Fall in.

920
01:39:29,230 --> 01:39:31,699
I'm done with this mission.

921
01:39:36,537 --> 01:39:39,097
Hey! Hey!

922
01:39:39,907 --> 01:39:41,966
- Sir...
- Don't you walk away from your captain!

923
01:39:42,143 --> 01:39:44,373
- Reiben, get back in line!
- No, sir.

924
01:39:44,545 --> 01:39:47,276
I'll spend the rest of my life
in the stockade rather than go on.

925
01:39:47,448 --> 01:39:49,883
- I'm not going to ask
you again.
- Captain!

926
01:39:50,051 --> 01:39:52,486
- This is bullshit!
- Fallin!

927
01:39:52,653 --> 01:39:55,918
- Are you going to shoot me over Ryan?
- No, because I don't like you.

928
01:39:56,090 --> 01:39:58,320
If he wants to go, just let him go!

929
01:39:58,493 --> 01:40:01,758
Are you letting this happen? Captain!
You see this?

930
01:40:01,929 --> 01:40:04,921
Captain. Sir, Ryan's dead.

931
01:40:05,099 --> 01:40:07,500
- Bullshit!
- We have a situation here.

932
01:40:07,668 --> 01:40:10,103
I have a sixth sense.
I know it in my bones.

933
01:40:10,271 --> 01:40:12,968
We didn't kill the Kraut.
Now you're going to shoot me.

934
01:40:13,140 --> 01:40:15,472
- He's better than you.
- Just do it!

935
01:40:15,643 --> 01:40:20,080
- Put one in my leg...
- I'll shoot you in your big mouth!

936
01:40:20,248 --> 01:40:21,943
Put your money
where your mouth is and do it!

937
01:40:22,116 --> 01:40:24,778
You don't know how to shut up.

938
01:40:24,952 --> 01:40:29,583
- Captain, please!
- What's the pool on me up to?

939
01:40:29,757 --> 01:40:33,091
- You are a coward son of a bitch!
- I'm waiting, Sarge.

940
01:40:33,261 --> 01:40:36,356
What's the pool on me up to right now?

941
01:40:36,531 --> 01:40:38,863
What's it up to?

942
01:40:39,033 --> 01:40:41,900
What is it? 300 dollars, is that it?

943
01:40:42,069 --> 01:40:44,333
I'm a schoolteacher.

944
01:40:47,875 --> 01:40:51,175
I teach English Composition...

945
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:53,746
in this little town
called Addley, Pennsylvania.

946
01:40:53,915 --> 01:40:59,081
In the last 11 years, I've been at
Thomas Alva Edison High School.

947
01:41:01,188 --> 01:41:05,557
I was the coach of
the baseball team in the springtime.

948
01:41:07,562 --> 01:41:09,326
I'l be doggone.

949
01:41:09,497 --> 01:41:12,990
Back home, when I tell people
what I do for a living -

950
01:41:13,167 --> 01:41:16,865
- they think, "Well, that figures."

951
01:41:17,905 --> 01:41:21,671
But over here, it's...

952
01:41:21,842 --> 01:41:26,177
.a big, big mystery.

953
01:41:27,415 --> 01:41:31,374
So, I guess I've changed some.

954
01:41:32,687 --> 01:41:35,884
Sometimes I wonder
if I've changed so much -

955
01:41:36,057 --> 01:41:40,153
- my wife is even going to recognise me
whenever I get back fo her...

956
01:41:42,029 --> 01:41:44,930
..and how I'll ever be able to...

957
01:41:47,134 --> 01:41:50,069
fell her about days like today.

958
01:41:55,643 --> 01:41:59,204
I don't know anything about Ryan.
I don't care.

959
01:41:59,380 --> 01:42:01,405
He means nothing to me,
it's just a name, -

960
01:42:01,582 --> 01:42:08,818
- but if going to Ramelle
and finding him so he can go home, -

961
01:42:08,990 --> 01:42:12,824
- if that earns me the right
to get back to my wife, then...

962
01:42:12,994 --> 01:42:16,055
.then that's my mission.

963
01:42:17,131 --> 01:42:22,592
You want to leave?
You want to go off and fight the war?

964
01:42:24,772 --> 01:42:27,434
Alright.

965
01:42:27,608 --> 01:42:34,605
Alright, I won't stop you.
I'll even put in the paperwork.

966
01:42:34,782 --> 01:42:39,583
I just know that with every man I kill,
the farther away from home I feel.

967
01:44:04,338 --> 01:44:09,333
...by memories of days gone by

968
01:44:11,178 --> 01:44:16,082
In my solitude you taunt me

969
01:44:16,250 --> 01:44:21,051
with memories that never die

970
01:44:21,222 --> 01:44:26,092
I sit in my chair
filled with despair

971
01:44:26,260 --> 01:44:31,289
There's no one could be so sad

972
01:44:31,465 --> 01:44:35,902
With gloom everywhere
1 sit and I stare

973
01:44:36,070 --> 01:44:40,632
1 know that I'll soon go mad

974
01:44:49,784 --> 01:44:51,912
Halftrack! Cover!

975
01:45:07,635 --> 01:45:11,572
Who's doing the shooting?
Who's doing the shooting?

976
01:45:32,026 --> 01:45:34,518
Get ready to move. Take their left flank!

977
01:45:34,695 --> 01:45:36,925
Hold on and make sure they're down.

978
01:45:58,419 --> 01:46:01,582
101st! We're coming out!

979
01:46:08,529 --> 01:46:11,499
That was a recon. element, 2nd SS.

980
01:46:12,867 --> 01:46:16,394
We've been expecting a probe.
That must have been it.

981
01:46:18,239 --> 01:46:21,573
Captain Miller, Charlie Company,
2nd Rangers.

982
01:46:21,742 --> 01:46:23,870
Corporal Henderson,
Easy Company, 501st.

983
01:46:24,044 --> 01:46:27,912
- Ryan, First of 506th.
- Toynbee, Third of 506th.

984
01:46:28,082 --> 01:46:33,851
- James Francis Ryan?
- Yes, sir. How did you guess that?

985
01:46:44,598 --> 01:46:50,970
- Looks like you got hit pretty hard.
- Yes, sir. Small unit action.

986
01:46:53,307 --> 01:46:57,710
They came in
and beat the hell out of us with 88s.

987
01:47:03,183 --> 01:47:06,642
Tell you what. If you're our relief,
I'm going to file a complaint.

988
01:47:06,820 --> 01:47:09,312
I wouldn't blame you.

989
01:47:09,490 --> 01:47:12,721
Who's your CO?

990
01:47:12,893 --> 01:47:15,555
It would've been Captain Jennings.

991
01:47:15,729 --> 01:47:18,892
I'm afraid the best
we can muster up now is a corporal.

992
01:47:20,301 --> 01:47:23,327
So what are you guys all about?

993
01:47:23,504 --> 01:47:27,065
We're here for him. Ryan.

994
01:47:27,241 --> 01:47:29,107
Me, sir?

995
01:47:38,018 --> 01:47:41,283
James Francis Ryan of lowa?

996
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:46,621
Yes, sir. Peyton, lowa, that's correct.
What is this about?

997
01:47:48,629 --> 01:47:51,360
Your brothers were killed in combat.

998
01:47:58,305 --> 01:48:00,296
Which ones?

999
01:48:02,810 --> 01:48:05,142
All of them.

1000
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:15,782
On the level?

1001
01:48:17,091 --> 01:48:20,493
Yeah, I'm afraid so.

1002
01:48:21,729 --> 01:48:23,720
You might want to
take some time with this.

1003
01:48:23,897 --> 01:48:27,197
If there's someplace
you want to go and...

1004
01:48:35,943 --> 01:48:38,810
- What's this all about?
- Ryan lost his brothers.

1005
01:48:38,979 --> 01:48:42,074
- Which one?
- All of them.

1006
01:48:50,324 --> 01:48:53,055
You came all the way out here
to tell me that?

1007
01:48:55,396 --> 01:48:58,661
You're going home.

1008
01:48:58,832 --> 01:49:01,597
Our orders are to bring you back.

1009
01:49:05,072 --> 01:49:07,302
Bring me back?

1010
01:49:08,842 --> 01:49:13,678
Corporal, I don't mean to leave you more
short-handed, but orders are orders.

1011
01:49:13,847 --> 01:49:16,509
Any communications about
when you will be relieved?

1012
01:49:16,683 --> 01:49:19,675
We can't tell. We don't know
what's happening south of us.

1013
01:49:19,853 --> 01:49:23,221
My orders don't include me
abandoning my post.

1014
01:49:23,390 --> 01:49:26,052
I understand that,
but this changes things.

1015
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:28,524
I don't see that it does, sir.

1016
01:49:30,130 --> 01:49:33,760
The Chief of Staff for the US Army
says it does.

1017
01:49:33,934 --> 01:49:36,164
Our orders are to
hold this bridge at all costs.

1018
01:49:36,336 --> 01:49:39,465
Our planes in the 82nd have taken out
every bridge across the Merderet, -

1019
01:49:39,640 --> 01:49:42,473
- with the exception of two:
one at Valognes and this one.

1020
01:49:42,643 --> 01:49:45,203
If the Germans take it,
we'll have to displace.

1021
01:49:45,379 --> 01:49:50,340
Private. It's one thing that your outfit
wants to stay, but your party's over here.

1022
01:49:50,517 --> 01:49:52,417
I can't leave
before the reinforcements are here.

1023
01:49:52,586 --> 01:49:55,021
You've got three
minutes to get your gear.

1024
01:49:55,189 --> 01:49:58,955
- What about them, there's barely...
- Hey, asshole!

1025
01:49:59,126 --> 01:50:03,063
Two of our guys
already died trying to find you.

1026
01:50:08,535 --> 01:50:11,505
-Sir?
- That's right.

1027
01:50:21,048 --> 01:50:25,417
- What were their names?
- Irwin Wade and Adrian Caparzo.

1028
01:50:27,554 --> 01:50:29,147
Wade and..?

1029
01:50:30,390 --> 01:50:32,154
Caparzo.

1030
01:50:44,438 --> 01:50:46,805
It doesn't make any sense.

1031
01:50:48,909 --> 01:50:53,073
It doesn't make any sense, sir.
Why do / deserve to go?

1032
01:50:53,247 --> 01:50:56,148
Why not any of these guys?
They all fought just as hard.

1033
01:51:01,088 --> 01:51:04,217
Is that what
they're supposed to tell your mother -

1034
01:51:04,391 --> 01:51:07,520
- when they send her
another folded American flag?

1035
01:51:14,701 --> 01:51:18,001
Tell her that when you found me
I was here, -

1036
01:51:18,172 --> 01:51:20,971
- and I was with the only brothers
that I have left, -

1037
01:51:21,141 --> 01:51:25,271
- and that there was no way
I was going to desert them.

1038
01:51:25,445 --> 01:51:30,645
I think she'll understand that.
There's no way I'm leaving this bridge.

1039
01:52:13,660 --> 01:52:15,788
What are your orders?

1040
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:21,593
Sergeant, we have crossed
some strange boundary here.

1041
01:52:21,768 --> 01:52:24,362
Our world has taken a turn
for the surreal.

1042
01:52:24,538 --> 01:52:27,974
Clearly, but the question still stands.

1043
01:52:28,141 --> 01:52:32,044
I don't know. What do you think?

1044
01:52:32,212 --> 01:52:34,772
You don't want to know what I think.

1045
01:52:36,783 --> 01:52:38,979
No, Mike, I do.

1046
01:52:42,122 --> 01:52:46,059
Part of me thinks the kid's right.
What's he done to deserve this?

1047
01:52:46,226 --> 01:52:50,288
If he wants to stay here, fine.
Let's leave him and go home.

1048
01:52:51,231 --> 01:52:53,131
Yeah.

1049
01:52:53,300 --> 01:52:58,466
But another part of me thinks,
"What if by some miracle we stay" -

1050
01:52:58,639 --> 01:53:01,438
- "and actually make it out of here?"

1051
01:53:01,608 --> 01:53:05,567
Some day we might look back on this
and decide that -

1052
01:53:05,746 --> 01:53:10,274
- saving Private Ryan was
the one decent thing we pulled out of -

1053
01:53:10,450 --> 01:53:15,251
- this whole godawful, shitty mess.

1054
01:53:15,422 --> 01:53:22,260
That's what I was thinking, sir.
Like you said, Captain.

1055
01:53:23,730 --> 01:53:28,930
We do that,
we all earn the right to go home.

1056
01:53:31,705 --> 01:53:33,867
Oh, brother...

1057
01:53:36,476 --> 01:53:39,446
This is everything.

1058
01:53:39,613 --> 01:53:45,780
You've got the .230 calibre machine
guns, 17 grenades, 11 Hawkins mines.

1059
01:53:45,952 --> 01:53:49,183
You've got two bazookas,
but they've only got eight rounds left.

1060
01:53:49,356 --> 01:53:51,518
And assorted small arms.

1061
01:53:51,692 --> 01:53:54,957
We had a .60 mortar,
but an arty round took it out.

1062
01:53:55,128 --> 01:53:57,790
Might as well be spit wads
if they roll on us with tanks.

1063
01:53:57,964 --> 01:54:02,595
- Which they're sure to do.
- What are you thinking, sir?

1064
01:54:02,769 --> 01:54:06,228
I'm thinking I'm going to
whip around the flanks.

1065
01:54:10,510 --> 01:54:13,810
Unless we can draw them up
the main road between the buildings, -

1066
01:54:13,980 --> 01:54:17,541
- where all the rubble
makes a bit of a bottleneck...

1067
01:54:17,718 --> 01:54:19,914
- Disable him?
- If we can.

1068
01:54:20,087 --> 01:54:23,751
Make a 60-tonne roadblock. Then
we've got a fighting chance at her flanks.

1069
01:54:23,924 --> 01:54:26,086
Good. Split them up,
don't let them mass.

1070
01:54:26,259 --> 01:54:29,160
Hit them hard one-on-one,
and fall back to the bridge.

1071
01:54:29,329 --> 01:54:33,698
Machine gun on the move down here,
number two up high to piss on them.

1072
01:54:33,867 --> 01:54:38,395
That would be the idea. Jackson!

1073
01:54:38,572 --> 01:54:40,904
If we can,
I'd like to get you up in that bell tower.

1074
01:54:41,074 --> 01:54:44,169
- Yes, sir.
- I'll give you some company.

1075
01:54:44,344 --> 01:54:50,306
Some company couldn't hurt. A .30
with about a 1,000 rounds would be OK.

1076
01:54:50,484 --> 01:54:52,475
Parker, job opportunity.

1077
01:54:52,652 --> 01:54:54,450
It's not the worst idea ever, -

1078
01:54:54,621 --> 01:54:58,319
- but everything depends on getting the
tank down the road for us to knock out.

1079
01:54:58,492 --> 01:55:01,860
How the hell do you plan on doing that?

1080
01:55:02,028 --> 01:55:04,725
He's right. As our colleague
from Airborne pointed out -

1081
01:55:04,898 --> 01:55:07,196
- what we've got is a bunch of spit wads.

1082
01:55:07,367 --> 01:55:11,235
How do we stop the tank
if we get it to commit?

1083
01:55:11,405 --> 01:55:12,930
Give it a rabbit to chase.

1084
01:55:13,907 --> 01:55:16,604
We could hit the tank in the tracks.

1085
01:55:17,244 --> 01:55:18,609
Yeah, but with what?

1086
01:55:21,047 --> 01:55:25,883
- We could try a sticky bomb.
- Sticky bomb, sir?

1087
01:55:26,052 --> 01:55:28,248
Sir, are you making that up?

1088
01:55:28,422 --> 01:55:31,653
No, it's in the field manual.
Check it out, if you want to.

1089
01:55:31,825 --> 01:55:35,989
We seem to be out of field manuals.
Perhaps you could enlighten us.

1090
01:55:36,163 --> 01:55:39,428
You have some demolition, don't you?
TNT or Composition B?

1091
01:55:39,599 --> 01:55:43,832
Plenty. I've got that bridge wired with
enough Composition B to blow it twice.

1092
01:55:44,004 --> 01:55:45,563
You can spare some, then.

1093
01:55:46,273 --> 01:55:52,679
You take a standard Gl sock,
cram it full with Composition B, -

1094
01:55:52,846 --> 01:55:57,909
- and rig up a simple fuse. Then you
coat the whole thing with axle grease.

1095
01:55:58,084 --> 01:56:01,486
That way, when you throw it,
it should stick.

1096
01:56:01,655 --> 01:56:04,181
It's a bomb that sticks.
It's a sticky bomb.

1097
01:56:04,357 --> 01:56:08,316
Come up with a better way to knock
the tracks off a tank, I'm all ears.

1098
01:56:08,495 --> 01:56:12,056
This is good.
Now we have to surrender our socks!

1099
01:56:26,513 --> 01:56:28,140
Haul away.

1100
01:56:41,795 --> 01:56:46,198
Select the field of fire.
Crossfire with the one in the bell tower.

1101
01:56:46,366 --> 01:56:48,357
I can cover 12 to 9 from here.

1102
01:56:52,572 --> 01:56:55,132
- Easy!
- I've got her!

1103
01:57:29,175 --> 01:57:31,143
Here are the mines.

1104
01:57:41,488 --> 01:57:44,287
For being the best we can do, -

1105
01:57:44,457 --> 01:57:49,361
- that forward machine gun
is not in a terrible firing position.

1106
01:57:50,997 --> 01:57:53,466
And this position right here...

1107
01:57:55,669 --> 01:57:57,763
This is the Alamo.

1108
01:57:57,938 --> 01:58:01,306
They push us this far,
the last man alive blows the bridge.

1109
01:58:01,474 --> 01:58:04,375
We've only got a 30-second delay
on the fuse, so tell everyone -

1110
01:58:04,544 --> 01:58:09,209
- that if you're last you'd better hurry
or you'll not live long.

1111
01:58:10,050 --> 01:58:14,044
Captain? Where am I during all this?

1112
01:58:14,220 --> 01:58:18,589
Never more than two feet away from me.
And that's not negotiable.

1113
01:58:19,593 --> 01:58:23,052
I'm going to get some ammo. Come on.

1114
01:58:25,131 --> 01:58:28,396
- Hey, Upham, listen to me.
-Yes.

1115
01:58:28,568 --> 01:58:30,969
- Are you listening?
- Yes.

1116
01:58:31,137 --> 01:58:34,801
We're going to be displacing and falling
back like crazy sons of bitches, -

1117
01:58:34,975 --> 01:58:39,572
- 80 you've got to be Johnny-on-the-spot
with the ammo, or we're dead.

1118
01:58:39,746 --> 01:58:41,180
- Do you understand?
- Johnny-on-the-spot.

1119
01:58:41,348 --> 01:58:45,251
- Yeah. Are you alright?
- Yeah.

1120
01:58:46,519 --> 01:58:49,682
When we shipped out of England
we got cigarettes -

1121
01:58:49,856 --> 01:58:52,655
-and I said,
"No, thank you. I don't smoke."

1122
01:58:57,230 --> 01:59:01,326
- Quite a situation, huh?
- Unbelievable.

1123
01:59:01,501 --> 01:59:07,304
Yeah. "Fucked-Up
Beyond All Recognition”, right?

1124
01:59:07,474 --> 01:59:10,000
You've got that right.

1125
01:59:11,745 --> 01:59:15,113
-"FUBAR'"!
- Alright!

1126
01:59:15,281 --> 01:59:16,544
Ouch.

1127
01:59:16,716 --> 01:59:20,846
Yeah, well...
It's going to be a real show, huh?

1128
01:59:21,021 --> 01:59:22,989
Yeah, OK.

1129
01:59:29,062 --> 01:59:30,962
Take it easy.

1130
01:59:31,865 --> 01:59:33,594
"FUBAR."

1131
02:00:11,371 --> 02:00:14,500
Who's that singing, sir?

1132
02:00:14,674 --> 02:00:16,642
Edith Piaf.

1133
02:00:18,111 --> 02:00:21,411
What is she so upset about?

1134
02:00:21,581 --> 02:00:26,747
Her lover left her, but she still
sees his face everywhere she goes.

1135
02:00:27,987 --> 02:00:29,819
That would do it.

1136
02:00:58,985 --> 02:01:02,216
"Even life itself only represents you."

1137
02:01:05,091 --> 02:01:07,651
"Sometimes I dream
that I'm in your arms."

1138
02:01:07,827 --> 02:01:11,286
- What was that? She sang it before.
- The chorus.

1139
02:01:11,464 --> 02:01:13,193
The chorus.

1140
02:01:13,366 --> 02:01:16,301
"And you speak softly in my ear."

1141
02:01:17,937 --> 02:01:23,000
"And you say things .
that make my eyes close.

1142
02:01:25,278 --> 02:01:27,110
"And I find that marvellous."

1143
02:01:27,280 --> 02:01:30,545
Again, Upham...

1144
02:01:30,717 --> 02:01:35,985
..fo be honest,
I find myself curiously aroused by you.

1145
02:01:36,156 --> 02:01:37,715
Marvellous.

1146
02:01:37,891 --> 02:01:41,657
It's a really melancholy song.
At the beginning of the song she says:

1147
02:01:41,828 --> 02:01:47,665
"And then one day you left me
and I've been desperate ever since."

1148
02:01:47,834 --> 02:01:50,860
"I see you all over the sky,
I see you all over the earth."

1149
02:01:51,037 --> 02:01:54,496
Any more songs like this,
the Krauts won't have to shoot me.

1150
02:01:54,674 --> 02:01:57,336
I'm just going to slit my own wrists.

1151
02:01:57,510 --> 02:02:00,002
You're a strange bird, Upham.

1152
02:02:00,180 --> 02:02:02,171
I'm sorry. It's Edith, you know.

1153
02:02:02,348 --> 02:02:04,146
You know what that song
reminds me of?

1154
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:08,515
Mrs. Rachel Troubowitz and
what she said when I left for Basic.

1155
02:02:08,688 --> 02:02:11,180
What? "Don't touch me?"

1156
02:02:11,357 --> 02:02:13,826
No. She's our Super's wife.

1157
02:02:13,993 --> 02:02:20,490
She comes into my mum's shop to try
a few things. She's like a 44 Double E.

1158
02:02:20,667 --> 02:02:22,328
- Double E?
- They're massive.

1159
02:02:22,502 --> 02:02:23,901
Those are big titties.

1160
02:02:24,070 --> 02:02:28,098
I've got her convinced that she's a 42 D.
So we're in the dressing room -

1161
02:02:28,274 --> 02:02:32,302
- and she fries to get into this side-cut,
silk-ribboned, triple-panel girdle -

1162
02:02:32,478 --> 02:02:34,845
- with the shelf-lift brassiére.

1163
02:02:35,014 --> 02:02:37,381
It's beautiful.
She's pouring out of this thing.

1164
02:02:37,550 --> 02:02:39,314
- Is it tight?
- No, it's beautiful.

1165
02:02:39,485 --> 02:02:43,649
She sees me and can tell I've got a
hard-on the size of the Statue of Liberty.

1166
02:02:43,823 --> 02:02:47,225
She says, "Richard, calm down",
and she says, -

1167
02:02:47,393 --> 02:02:51,330
"Over there, if you see anything
that upsets you, if you're scared," -

1168
02:02:51,497 --> 02:02:57,960
- "I want you to close your eyes
and think of these, you understand?"

1169
02:02:58,137 --> 02:03:00,697
So I said, "Yes, ma'am."

1170
02:03:13,286 --> 02:03:16,278
Are you alright, sir?

1171
02:03:16,456 --> 02:03:18,891
Yeah, I'm just keeping the rhythm.

1172
02:03:24,130 --> 02:03:27,998
Is it true
you were a teacher back home?

1173
02:03:28,167 --> 02:03:31,933
- Yes.
- That's something I could never do.

1174
02:03:32,105 --> 02:03:36,269
Not with the way me and my brothers
treated our teachers. No, sir!

1175
02:03:38,978 --> 02:03:42,073
I had a thousand kids like you.

1176
02:03:47,687 --> 02:03:51,555
I can't see my brothers' faces.

1177
02:03:51,724 --> 02:03:56,594
I've been trying and I can't see their
faces at all. Has that happened to you?

1178
02:03:56,763 --> 02:03:59,255
You've got to think of a context.

1179
02:04:01,301 --> 02:04:03,395
What does that mean?

1180
02:04:03,569 --> 02:04:07,301
You don't just think about their faces,
you think about something specific, -

1181
02:04:07,473 --> 02:04:09,840
- something you've done together.

1182
02:04:13,513 --> 02:04:16,346
When I want to think of home,
I think of something specific.

1183
02:04:16,516 --> 02:04:20,350
I think of my hammock in the backyard, -

1184
02:04:20,520 --> 02:04:25,924
- or my wife pruning the rose bushes
in a pair of my old work gloves.

1185
02:04:29,195 --> 02:04:34,725
This one night, two of my brothers
woke me up in the middle of the night.

1186
02:04:36,402 --> 02:04:39,770
They said they had a surprise for me.

1187
02:04:39,939 --> 02:04:43,136
They took me to the barn
up into the loft -

1188
02:04:43,309 --> 02:04:47,268
- and there was my oldest brother Dan -

1189
02:04:47,447 --> 02:04:50,508
- with Alice Jardine!

1190
02:04:53,019 --> 02:04:57,547
Picture a girl who just
took a nosedive from the ugly tree -

1191
02:04:57,724 --> 02:05:00,955
- and hit every branch coming down!

1192
02:05:02,228 --> 02:05:04,856
And Dan's got her shirt off...

1193
02:05:05,031 --> 02:05:11,767
So he's trying to get her bra off
and all of a sudden Sean screams out:

1194
02:05:11,938 --> 02:05:15,966
"Danny, you're a young man.
Don't do it!"

1195
02:05:17,643 --> 02:05:21,204
Alice Jardine hears this
and she screams and jumps up -

1196
02:05:21,381 --> 02:05:24,817
- and tries to run out,
but she's got her shirt over her head.

1197
02:05:24,984 --> 02:05:28,852
She runs into the wall
and knocks herself out.

1198
02:05:29,022 --> 02:05:32,959
Now Dan is so mad at us.
He starts coming after us, -

1199
02:05:33,126 --> 02:05:37,495
- but at the same time Alice is
unconscious. He's got to wake her up.

1200
02:05:37,663 --> 02:05:40,394
He grabs her by a leg and drags her -

1201
02:05:40,566 --> 02:05:43,934
- and at the same time he picks up
a shovel and goes after Sean!

1202
02:05:44,103 --> 02:05:49,041
And Sean says, "Why are you
trying to hit me? I just did you a favour!"

1203
02:05:49,942 --> 02:05:53,810
This makes Dan more angry.
He tries to swing this thing.

1204
02:05:53,980 --> 02:05:57,712
He loses his shovel. It goes out
of his grasp and hits a kerosene lantern.

1205
02:05:57,884 --> 02:06:03,516
The thing explodes. The whole barn
almost goes up because of this thing.

1206
02:06:17,570 --> 02:06:20,938
That was it, that was the last...
Dan went off to Basic the next day.

1207
02:06:21,107 --> 02:06:24,805
That was the last night
the four of us were together.

1208
02:06:24,977 --> 02:06:27,071
That was two years ago.

1209
02:06:29,115 --> 02:06:31,243
Oh, my.

1210
02:06:32,285 --> 02:06:37,018
Tell me about your wife
and those rose bushes.

1211
02:06:37,190 --> 02:06:42,128
No. No, that one I save just for me.

1212
02:07:47,660 --> 02:07:49,355
Enemy from the east.

1213
02:07:50,997 --> 02:07:55,628
He sees two Tiger tanks,
two Panzer tanks.

1214
02:07:55,801 --> 02:07:59,760
Infantry. 50 plus change.

1215
02:08:08,581 --> 02:08:11,642
Disperse! You know what to do.
Reiben, get on the rabbit.

1216
02:08:11,817 --> 02:08:16,084
- Upham, get some cover.
- Mellish and Henderson, lock and load!

1217
02:08:16,255 --> 02:08:18,815
Everybody check your ammo!

1218
02:08:18,991 --> 02:08:23,690
- Good luck, Reiben!
- I don't need any luck, I was born lucky!

1219
02:08:36,709 --> 02:08:40,077
- One in five tracer.
- Yes, and tracers point both ways.

1220
02:08:40,246 --> 02:08:43,546
Why don't you check the head space
and she should run.

1221
02:08:51,924 --> 02:08:54,825
Upham, hustle up!

1222
02:09:44,543 --> 02:09:48,480
Corporal Upham. We don't have
a .30 calibre machine gun here.

1223
02:09:48,648 --> 02:09:54,178
Either Mister Mellish or Mr Jackson
in the bell tower needs that.

1224
02:09:54,353 --> 02:09:57,482
Upham! Jackson's fine,
turn around to Mellish!

1225
02:10:18,944 --> 02:10:22,710
There's a ton of infantry.
I don't know if they took the bait, though.

1226
02:10:46,806 --> 02:10:49,104
Have you got any more of that?

1227
02:11:34,887 --> 02:11:37,151
The Panzers didn't take the bait.

1228
02:11:42,161 --> 02:11:44,926
The infantry's moving to the left.

1229
02:11:45,097 --> 02:11:48,294
A half-track just went by
with about 20 troops.

1230
02:13:27,266 --> 02:13:30,964
Mellish, Henderson! Displace!

1231
02:13:52,057 --> 02:13:55,994
Do it, now! Light it up!
You! Light it!

1232
02:14:07,273 --> 02:14:11,676
30 infantry on the right flank. Get over
there, find a hole and stop them!

1233
02:14:11,844 --> 02:14:14,370
Displace!

1234
02:14:25,157 --> 02:14:26,955
Upham!

1235
02:14:41,707 --> 02:14:44,699
- Clear!
- OK, go!

1236
02:14:44,877 --> 02:14:46,641
Krauts!

1237
02:14:48,213 --> 02:14:50,477
Right flank!

1238
02:15:26,118 --> 02:15:29,019
Get down, get down!

1239
02:15:35,394 --> 02:15:38,557
Upham! Thirty cal, hurry!

1240
02:15:38,731 --> 02:15:41,996
Find the Captain,
this flank's going to fold!

1241
02:16:36,955 --> 02:16:39,390
Traversing! He's still in this fight!

1242
02:16:40,859 --> 02:16:43,487
No! Ryan, get down, get down!

1243
02:16:56,308 --> 02:16:58,572
Ryan!

1244
02:17:16,795 --> 02:17:18,627
Ryan!

1245
02:17:19,898 --> 02:17:22,230
- Keep your mouth shut
- Get off me!

1246
02:17:22,401 --> 02:17:24,165
- Are you alright?
- Get off of me!

1247
02:17:24,336 --> 02:17:26,862
I'm fine too, Captain. Thanks.

1248
02:17:27,039 --> 02:17:31,567
Hit them from both sides.
Get aboard! Get a grenade in there!

1249
02:17:35,547 --> 02:17:37,015
Grenade!

1250
02:17:38,751 --> 02:17:41,721
20 mill! 20 mill!

1251
02:17:41,887 --> 02:17:43,582
Flak gun, 20 mm. Take it out!

1252
02:17:57,002 --> 02:18:00,438
Heavy weapon in defilade below!
I ain't got a shot!

1253
02:18:04,943 --> 02:18:09,312
Pincer move! Parker!
Targets eight o'clock, low!

1254
02:18:09,481 --> 02:18:11,643
God grant me strength.

1255
02:18:25,030 --> 02:18:28,227
Let's go, displace! Come on!

1256
02:18:44,583 --> 02:18:47,814
Cover! Upham, cover!

1257
02:19:04,002 --> 02:19:06,130
I'm out of .30 calibre.

1258
02:19:09,508 --> 02:19:12,102
Blessed be the Lord my strength,
which teaches my hands to war -

1259
02:19:12,277 --> 02:19:14,644
- and my fingers to fight.

1260
02:19:23,222 --> 02:19:27,716
My goodness and my fortress.
My high tower and deliverer.

1261
02:19:31,063 --> 02:19:33,828
My shield and He in whom I trust.

1262
02:19:37,369 --> 02:19:39,463
Here you go, baby.

1263
02:20:01,994 --> 02:20:04,258
Parker, get down!

1264
02:20:25,384 --> 02:20:27,716
Captain, that 20 mm is killing us.

1265
02:20:27,886 --> 02:20:32,517
- We've got to try to flank it somehow.
- Let me get over there for a top shot.

1266
02:20:57,683 --> 02:20:59,651
Upham!

1267
02:21:17,903 --> 02:21:22,807
Upham, Upham!
Upham, ammo, goddammit!

1268
02:22:05,884 --> 02:22:09,752
- I'm jammed! Got any .30 calibre?
- I'm out.

1269
02:22:21,800 --> 02:22:24,269
Upham. Upham!

1270
02:23:16,922 --> 02:23:18,549
Reiben!

1271
02:23:22,027 --> 02:23:23,256
Reiben!

1272
02:23:50,388 --> 02:23:54,757
I'm out! I need another bandolier.
Anybody got a bandolier?

1273
02:24:25,924 --> 02:24:28,052
You piece of shit!

1274
02:25:12,537 --> 02:25:17,703
Let's stop, let's stop!
Listen to me! Stop! No, no, no...

1275
02:25:44,436 --> 02:25:46,234
Fuck!

1276
02:25:54,045 --> 02:25:58,607
Son of a bitch, son of a bitch!

1277
02:25:58,783 --> 02:26:00,945
Son of a bitch!

1278
02:27:22,267 --> 02:27:26,704
- I'm out!
- Those .60 rounds...

1279
02:27:26,871 --> 02:27:29,772
- We can use them without the tube.
- How?

1280
02:27:29,941 --> 02:27:33,241
Fuse-arming wire, set back
and heave it!

1281
02:27:48,526 --> 02:27:50,961
Panzer schreck!

1282
02:28:08,046 --> 02:28:10,105
Go, go!

1283
02:28:24,496 --> 02:28:27,090
We're going to the Alamo.

1284
02:28:36,908 --> 02:28:39,206
Alamo! Alamo!

1285
02:28:58,396 --> 02:29:01,957
- We'll take it. You fall back!
- You be right behind us!

1286
02:29:02,133 --> 02:29:04,124
As soon as we're in business.

1287
02:29:08,173 --> 02:29:10,642
Displace. Reiben!

1288
02:29:12,877 --> 02:29:14,971
Reload!

1289
02:30:03,094 --> 02:30:04,619
Alright, go!

1290
02:30:05,730 --> 02:30:08,665
- We're blowing the bridge! Get off!
- Off the bridge!

1291
02:30:32,724 --> 02:30:35,625
Sarge! Mike, are you alright?

1292
02:30:35,793 --> 02:30:38,228
- 1 just got the wind knocked out of me.
- Let's go!

1293
02:30:38,396 --> 02:30:41,331
Take cover, we're going to
blow this bridge!

1294
02:30:43,234 --> 02:30:44,998
Come on!

1295
02:30:49,674 --> 02:30:52,041
Tiger company's
coming across the bridge.

1296
02:31:24,742 --> 02:31:27,973
Captain, get behind something!

1297
02:31:53,771 --> 02:31:55,569
Mike!

1298
02:32:00,311 --> 02:32:02,109
Mike!

1299
02:32:44,555 --> 02:32:48,685
Captain, where the hell are you going?
Captain, get back here!

1300
02:34:41,739 --> 02:34:43,229
Upham!

1301
02:35:12,837 --> 02:35:15,033
Hang in there.

1302
02:36:00,351 --> 02:36:02,376
Medic!

1303
02:36:04,922 --> 02:36:07,653
Medic! We've got a medic?

1304
02:36:14,232 --> 02:36:17,964
They're tankbusters, sir. P-51s.

1305
02:36:18,135 --> 02:36:20,297
Angels on our shoulders.

1306
02:36:26,244 --> 02:36:28,406
What, sir?

1307
02:36:32,383 --> 02:36:34,511
James...

1308
02:36:35,686 --> 02:36:37,882
Earn this.

1309
02:36:41,392 --> 02:36:43,793
Eam it.

1310
02:37:12,089 --> 02:37:15,389
"My dear Mrs Ryan."

1311
02:37:15,559 --> 02:37:19,553
"I's with a profound sense of joy
that I write to inform you" -

1312
02:37:19,730 --> 02:37:24,065
- "that your son,
Private James Ryan, is well" -

1313
02:37:24,235 --> 02:37:29,036
- "and at this moment on his way
home from European battlefields."

1314
02:37:29,206 --> 02:37:33,404
"Reports indicate that James
did his duty in combat" -

1315
02:37:33,577 --> 02:37:36,672
- "with great courage
and steadfast dedication” -

1316
02:37:36,847 --> 02:37:41,409
- "even after he was informed of
the loss your family has suffered" -

1317
02:37:41,585 --> 02:37:46,580
- "in this great campaign to ]
rid the world of tyranny and oppression."

1318
02:37:46,757 --> 02:37:49,749
"I take great pleasure
in joining the Secretary of War," -

1319
02:37:49,927 --> 02:37:54,922
- "the men and women of the US Army,
and the citizens of a grateful nation" -

1320
02:37:55,099 --> 02:38:01,197
- "in wishing you good health and
many years of happiness with James."

1321
02:38:01,372 --> 02:38:05,900
"Nothing, not even the safe return
of a beloved son" -

1322
02:38:06,077 --> 02:38:10,139
- "can compensate you or the
thousands of other American families" -

1323
02:38:10,314 --> 02:38:13,648
- "who have suffered great loss
in this tragic war."

1324
02:38:13,818 --> 02:38:15,752
"I might share with you some words" -

1325
02:38:15,920 --> 02:38:21,450
- "which have sustained me through
nights of peril, loss and heartache," -

1326
02:38:21,625 --> 02:38:25,687
- "and I quote,
1 pray that our heavenly Father" -

1327
02:38:25,863 --> 02:38:29,197
- "may assuage the anguish
of your bereavement" -

1328
02:38:29,367 --> 02:38:33,235
- "and leave you only the cherished
memory of the loved and lost" -

1329
02:38:33,404 --> 02:38:35,805
- "and the solemn pride
that must be yours" -

1330
02:38:35,973 --> 02:38:41,275
- "to have laid a so costly a sacrifice
upon the altar of freedom."

1331
02:38:43,647 --> 02:38:46,173
"Yours very sincerely and respectfully,” -

1332
02:38:46,350 --> 02:38:49,718
- "George C. Marshall.
General, Chief of Staff."

1333
02:39:40,771 --> 02:39:45,834
My family is with me today.
They wanted to come with me.

1334
02:39:48,846 --> 02:39:54,216
To be honest with you, I wasn't sure
how I would feel coming back here.

1335
02:39:56,487 --> 02:40:02,256
Every day, I think about what you said
to me that day on the bridge.

1336
02:40:04,061 --> 02:40:08,430
I've tried to live my life
the best I could.

1337
02:40:08,599 --> 02:40:11,694
I hope that was enough.

1338
02:40:11,869 --> 02:40:16,238
I hope that at least in your eyes...

1339
02:40:16,407 --> 02:40:20,401
..I've earned what all of you
have done for me.

1340
02:40:33,657 --> 02:40:35,751
James.

1341
02:40:37,228 --> 02:40:40,323
"Captain John H. Miller."

1342
02:40:47,938 --> 02:40:52,933
- Tell me I have led a good life.
- What?

1343
02:40:53,110 --> 02:40:55,511
Tell me I'm a good man.

1344
02:41:02,586 --> 02:41:04,714
You are.

1345
02:45:00,057 --> 02:45:03,687
