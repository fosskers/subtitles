1
00:00:16,121 --> 00:00:18,492
Chihiro... Chihiro!

2
00:00:19,186 --> 00:00:20,449
We're almost there.

3
00:00:23,524 --> 00:00:25,253
This really is the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:25,659 --> 00:00:28,128
We'll have to drive into town just to go shopping.

5
00:00:28,428 --> 00:00:30,692
It'll be Home Sweet Home in no time.

6
00:00:33,033 --> 00:00:34,797
Look, there's the elementary.

7
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:36,797
Chihiro, that's your new school.

8
00:00:37,771 --> 00:00:39,967
What a nice little place.

9
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,542
I wanna go back to my old school.

10
00:00:54,488 --> 00:00:56,820
Mom, my flowers are all squished!

11
00:00:57,224 --> 00:00:59,488
What did you expect?
You've been clutching them since we left.

12
00:00:59,793 --> 00:01:02,490
We'll put them in water when we get to the house.

13
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,220
This sucks, I wanted my first bouquet

14
00:01:05,532 --> 00:01:07,330
to be more romantic or something.

15
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:09,229
What are you talking about?

16
00:01:09,503 --> 00:01:10,868
You got a rose for your birthday, didn't you?

17
00:01:11,204 --> 00:01:12,035
Yeah, one.

18
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:14,003
One's hardly a bouquet.

19
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:17,175
You dropped the card. I'm opening the window.

20
00:01:17,411 --> 00:01:18,503
Be good today,

21
00:01:18,779 --> 00:01:20,543
we've got a lot to do.

22
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:45,035
SPIRITED AWAY
For my Sisters. Happy birthday, 2025!
Translation by Colin W

23
00:01:57,351 --> 00:02:00,429
Huh? Did I miss the turnoff?

24
00:02:01,622 --> 00:02:03,056
I could have sworn...

25
00:02:03,357 --> 00:02:04,722
Isn't that it up there?

26
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,059
That green house on the end, right?

27
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:09,686
That's the one.

28
00:02:10,597 --> 00:02:11,996
I must have turned too early.

29
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,234
Maybe I can swing around somewhere up here...

30
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:16,061
Oh not again,

31
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:17,737
you're always getting us lost.

32
00:02:17,971 --> 00:02:19,564
Let's just take a look.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,908
What are those little houses?

34
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,938
The stone shrines? Spirits live in them.

35
00:02:30,917 --> 00:02:32,316
Dad, let's turn around...

36
00:02:32,586 --> 00:02:34,918
Don't worry sweetie,
this car's a four-wheel drive.

37
00:02:35,689 --> 00:02:37,088
Chihiro, put your seatbelt on.

38
00:02:57,477 --> 00:02:59,445
Slow down, you're going to get us killed!

39
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:02,343
A tunnel!

40
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:18,622
Where are we?

41
00:03:18,865 --> 00:03:20,629
It's an entrance to something.

42
00:03:21,568 --> 00:03:24,299
Let's just get out of here!

43
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:26,464
Chihiro!

44
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:29,070
You two...

45
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:31,635
Mortar walls?

46
00:03:32,212 --> 00:03:34,044
This place can't be that old.

47
00:03:44,291 --> 00:03:45,520
The wind's being sucked in...

48
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:47,155
What is all this?

49
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,293
Wanna take a peek?

50
00:03:48,495 --> 00:03:50,020
Looks like we can walk through.

51
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:52,288
This place gives me the creeps,
let's get out of here!

52
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,997
Come on scaredy-pants,
you'll be fine.

53
00:03:55,302 --> 00:03:56,667
Just a bit, I promise.

54
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:59,031
The movers will beat us to the house at this rate...

55
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,669
Don't sweat it, they've got the keys.

56
00:04:01,942 --> 00:04:03,137
They know what to do.

57
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:04,333
I guess so...

58
00:04:04,578 --> 00:04:06,342
No! I'm not going in there!

59
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,309
Dad, let's just go!

60
00:04:10,784 --> 00:04:12,115
Come on, it'll be fine.

61
00:04:12,486 --> 00:04:13,851
I'm not going!

62
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,525
Wait in the car then,
we'll be back in a minute.

63
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,360
Mom!

64
00:04:30,604 --> 00:04:31,833
Don't leave me!

65
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,942
Watch your step.

66
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:40,941
Chihiro, stop tugging my arm,

67
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,477
I can't walk straight.

68
00:05:14,614 --> 00:05:15,479
Where are we?

69
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,717
Hear that?

70
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,591
It's a train!

71
00:05:27,861 --> 00:05:29,488
We might be near a station.

72
00:05:29,763 --> 00:05:31,322
Come on, we'll find out soon enough!

73
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,300
What are houses doing here?

74
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:12,470
Just as I thought.

75
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:15,369
This is some run-down amusement park.

76
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:20,151
They built tons of these back in the 90s.

77
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,479
Then the bubble burst and they all went belly-up.

78
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,811
This has got to be one of those.

79
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,884
Where are you going?

80
00:06:28,154 --> 00:06:30,452
Dad, let's go home already!

81
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,886
Hey!

82
00:06:45,038 --> 00:06:47,735
Mom, that building's howling at us!

83
00:06:48,174 --> 00:06:49,005
It's just the wind.

84
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:51,469
What a nice place!

85
00:06:51,711 --> 00:06:54,180
I should have brought the sandwiches
from the car.

86
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,084
They even tried to put in a river.

87
00:07:04,658 --> 00:07:05,921
Smell that?

88
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,858
I smell barbeque.

89
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:10,028
You're right.

90
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,925
This place might still be operating.

91
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,859
Chihiro, hurry up.

92
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,862
Wait for me!

93
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,069
Over here.

94
00:07:55,809 --> 00:07:58,904
How disappointing...
It's all just restaurants.

95
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:00,754
I don't see anybody...

96
00:08:03,998 --> 00:08:05,037
There!

97
00:08:23,036 --> 00:08:24,094
In here.

98
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,236
Look at all this!

99
00:08:29,476 --> 00:08:32,241
'Scuse me, anyone around?

100
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:34,504
Come sit Chihiro,
the food looks wonderful.

101
00:08:35,248 --> 00:08:36,272
Anyone back there?

102
00:08:41,321 --> 00:08:42,083
Let's just start.

103
00:08:42,322 --> 00:08:44,620
They'll be by soon,
we can pay them then.

104
00:08:44,891 --> 00:08:45,619
Good point.

105
00:08:45,892 --> 00:08:47,417
Oh man, look at these...

106
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,287
I wonder what kind of bird this is.

107
00:08:51,498 --> 00:08:52,431
It's fantastic!

108
00:08:52,665 --> 00:08:54,292
Chihiro, you have to try this.

109
00:08:54,801 --> 00:08:55,768
I don't want any!

110
00:08:56,169 --> 00:08:58,934
Let's get out of here...
We're going to get in trouble.

111
00:08:59,305 --> 00:09:02,138
Don't worry kiddo,
your dad'll handle it.

112
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,475
And I've got plenty of cash on me.

113
00:09:08,681 --> 00:09:10,979
Come try this, already!
The meat is to die for.

114
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:13,981
Sauce.

115
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:14,880
Thanks.

116
00:09:25,765 --> 00:09:28,325
Mom! Dad!

117
00:10:37,804 --> 00:10:39,329
That's weird...

118
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,664
A train!

119
00:11:21,447 --> 00:11:23,313
You cannot be here!
You must leave!

120
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:27,317
The sun is setting! You have to hurry!

121
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:32,090
The lamps... Run!

122
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:34,817
I'll buy you some time.
Get back across the river!

123
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,802
Who was that?

124
00:11:59,819 --> 00:12:00,911
Dad!

125
00:12:02,088 --> 00:12:03,317
Dad, we gotta go!

126
00:12:03,823 --> 00:12:05,416
We have to hurry!

127
00:12:32,218 --> 00:12:33,811
Dad!

128
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,221
Mom!

129
00:12:44,731 --> 00:12:46,358
Mom!

130
00:13:08,655 --> 00:13:09,554
Water?

131
00:13:23,336 --> 00:13:24,360
No way...

132
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,070
I'm dreaming!
This isn't real!

133
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,071
Wake up! This isn't real!

134
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,911
Please...

135
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,817
Just a dream... just a dream...

136
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:44,920
Not real... none of it's real...

137
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,425
Wake up...

138
00:13:55,034 --> 00:13:56,263
I'm see-through!

139
00:13:59,472 --> 00:14:01,201
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

140
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:56,688
Don't be afraid, I'm a friend.

141
00:14:57,230 --> 00:14:58,857
No! No! No!

142
00:14:59,132 --> 00:15:00,998
Eat this, hurry.

143
00:15:01,267 --> 00:15:02,666
If you don't eat some of our food,

144
00:15:02,902 --> 00:15:03,801
you're going to disappear completely.

145
00:15:04,003 --> 00:15:04,663
No!

146
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,440
Trust me.

147
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:12,643
You won't turn into a pig.

148
00:15:12,845 --> 00:15:14,176
Chew it and swallow.

149
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:26,589
Good girl. You're safe now.

150
00:15:26,859 --> 00:15:28,088
See for yourself.

151
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:37,759
It worked...

152
00:15:38,037 --> 00:15:40,165
See? Now it's time to go.

153
00:15:40,373 --> 00:15:42,842
Where are my mom and dad?

154
00:15:43,075 --> 00:15:44,406
They didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

155
00:15:44,811 --> 00:15:47,007
We can't help them right now,
but I promise you'll see them soon.

156
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,481
Quiet.

157
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,962
They're looking for you.

158
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,729
We're out of time.
We'll run for it!

159
00:16:14,073 --> 00:16:16,371
I can't stand up!

160
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:18,034
My legs won't budge.

161
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,905
Relax and take a deep breath.

162
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:27,012
In the name of the Wind and Water within you...

163
00:16:27,286 --> 00:16:28,412
Release!

164
00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:29,482
Now stand!

165
00:17:12,231 --> 00:17:14,962
You'll have to hold your breath as we cross the bridge.

166
00:17:16,135 --> 00:17:18,263
If you take even one breath,

167
00:17:18,504 --> 00:17:21,439
the spell will break and you'll be seen.

168
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:27,971
I'm scared.

169
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,646
Relax.

170
00:17:30,149 --> 00:17:32,811
Good evening! Welcome!

171
00:17:33,085 --> 00:17:35,315
Welcome, welcome!

172
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:36,779
I have returned from my duties!

173
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:38,821
Welcome back, sir!

174
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,151
Breathe deep.

175
00:17:43,029 --> 00:17:43,996
Hold it!

176
00:18:01,113 --> 00:18:02,080
Welcome!

177
00:18:02,348 --> 00:18:04,180
We've been waiting for you!

178
00:18:06,352 --> 00:18:07,820
Just a bit further.

179
00:18:08,888 --> 00:18:10,322
Haku-sama!

180
00:18:11,157 --> 00:18:12,522
Where were you last night?

181
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:15,761
A human?

182
00:18:16,896 --> 00:18:17,863
Run!

183
00:18:37,049 --> 00:18:39,711
Smell that? There's a human sneaking about!

184
00:18:40,019 --> 00:18:41,885
What a stench.

185
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:42,883
They know you're close.

186
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,783
I'm sorry... He surprised me...

187
00:18:45,057 --> 00:18:47,082
You did well, Chihiro.

188
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,858
Listen to me carefully now.

189
00:18:50,096 --> 00:18:51,586
If you stay here, they'll find you.

190
00:18:52,331 --> 00:18:53,560
I'm going to head inside and
lead them away from you.

191
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,392
You have to escape while I have them confused.

192
00:18:55,668 --> 00:18:56,533
No! Don't leave me!

193
00:18:56,769 --> 00:18:58,100
Stay here with me, please!

194
00:18:58,537 --> 00:19:00,164
You don't understand.

195
00:19:00,373 --> 00:19:01,636
There's no other way for you to survive in this place.

196
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,602
Don't you want to rescue your parents?

197
00:19:04,844 --> 00:19:07,313
So... they really did turn into pigs...

198
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:08,547
Stay still.

199
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:11,246
When things calm down,

200
00:19:11,484 --> 00:19:13,213
head out the little door in the back.

201
00:19:13,452 --> 00:19:16,080
Take the stairs all the way to the bottom.

202
00:19:16,555 --> 00:19:18,546
That's where the boiler room is.

203
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,088
It's where they heat water for the baths.

204
00:19:20,359 --> 00:19:22,157
You'll find Kamajī inside.

205
00:19:22,428 --> 00:19:23,918
You must reach him.

206
00:19:24,296 --> 00:19:25,092
Kamajī?

207
00:19:26,098 --> 00:19:28,567
You're going to ask him for a job.

208
00:19:28,801 --> 00:19:30,360
He'll turn you down, but don't give up.

209
00:19:31,037 --> 00:19:32,436
It's the rule of this place.

210
00:19:32,705 --> 00:19:34,366
Yubāba turns those who won't work into animals.

211
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:35,941
Yubāba?

212
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:37,266
You'll know her when you see her.

213
00:19:37,576 --> 00:19:38,873
She's the witch who runs the bathhouse.

214
00:19:39,178 --> 00:19:40,509
But you must not complain.

215
00:19:40,713 --> 00:19:42,408
She'll make you want to quit,

216
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,116
but don't give in to her.

217
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:46,781
You'll get your chance for freedom,
just be patient.

218
00:19:47,053 --> 00:19:48,953
Do that, and there's nothing she can do to you.

219
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:49,950
Okay...

220
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,459
It's time.

221
00:19:54,727 --> 00:19:57,219
Remember, Chihiro. I'll always be on your side.

222
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,898
How do you know my name?

223
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,298
I've known you for a long time.

224
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:03,699
My name is Haku.

225
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,200
I'm here!

226
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:12,471
Sir, the Mistress is calling for you!

227
00:20:12,712 --> 00:20:15,738
I'm aware. What do you think I've been doing?

228
00:24:23,963 --> 00:24:25,453
Um...

229
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:27,895
Excuse me...

230
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,308
I, uh...

231
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,973
Are you Kamajī-san?

232
00:24:52,691 --> 00:24:54,819
I... Haku told me to come here

233
00:24:55,027 --> 00:24:56,620
and ask you for a job!

234
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:04,092
This many?

235
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:07,400
Break's over, people!

236
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:10,942
Yeah I'm old Kamajī...

237
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:13,872
Just a bag o' bones that boils the water.

238
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:16,070
You little runts, get out here already!

239
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:19,277
Um, well, please let me work here!

240
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:21,180
I've got all the help I need.

241
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:23,685
There's soot all over this place.

242
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:26,687
Lots of backup if I need it!

243
00:25:41,373 --> 00:25:42,932
Ah, sorry...

244
00:25:47,079 --> 00:25:48,638
Hold on.

245
00:26:00,893 --> 00:26:02,156
Out of the way.

246
00:26:55,547 --> 00:26:57,379
Now what?

247
00:27:04,423 --> 00:27:05,891
Can I just leave it here?

248
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,552
Finish what you started or stay out of the way!

249
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:09,913
You little slackers!

250
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,022
Want me to turn you back into dust?

251
00:28:12,291 --> 00:28:13,986
And you! Butting in where you don't belong

252
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:15,854
and stealing people's work!

253
00:28:16,061 --> 00:28:17,222
Listen, kid. If these little motes don't work,

254
00:28:17,429 --> 00:28:19,454
the magic binding them wears off
and they fall apart.

255
00:28:19,665 --> 00:28:21,360
There's no work here for you.

256
00:28:21,567 --> 00:28:22,762
Go beg somewhere else!

257
00:28:31,843 --> 00:28:34,141
Ingrates! You got a problem?

258
00:28:34,413 --> 00:28:35,812
Get back to work this instant!

259
00:28:37,149 --> 00:28:38,639
Breakfast time!

260
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,282
At it again, I see.

261
00:28:43,255 --> 00:28:45,952
And where's yesterday's bowl?

262
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:48,993
You know I told you to leave it by the door!

263
00:28:49,461 --> 00:28:51,725
Meal break! Come and get it!

264
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,508
Holy crap, a human!

265
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:12,079
They're freaking out upstairs over her!

266
00:29:13,318 --> 00:29:14,843
She's my grand-daughter.

267
00:29:15,087 --> 00:29:16,248
You have a...?

268
00:29:17,456 --> 00:29:19,083
Says she wants a job

269
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,019
but there's no room for her down here.

270
00:29:21,260 --> 00:29:22,022
Do me a favour.

271
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:24,695
Take her to Yubāba and get her sorted out.

272
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,556
It's up to her after that.

273
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:29,166
Like hell I will! Yubāba will take my head off!

274
00:29:29,401 --> 00:29:30,493
I'll sweeten the deal.

275
00:29:30,736 --> 00:29:34,104
Charred Imori... a delicacy.

276
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,831
Either way, if she wants a job

277
00:29:38,076 --> 00:29:40,170
she has to sign a contract with Yubāba.

278
00:29:40,412 --> 00:29:42,437
It's up to fate now, kiddo.

279
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,580
Alright brat, let's go.

280
00:29:52,758 --> 00:29:53,452
Hold it.

281
00:29:53,659 --> 00:29:55,647
Aren't you going to thank him?

282
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:56,785
Oh, right.

283
00:29:57,062 --> 00:29:58,461
Wonderful, you're stupid too. Let's go!

284
00:29:58,664 --> 00:29:59,563
Okay!

285
00:30:02,234 --> 00:30:04,202
The hell you need shoes for?

286
00:30:04,436 --> 00:30:05,232
Leave the socks too!

287
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:06,403
Okay!

288
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,035
Well, did you say thank you?

289
00:30:14,279 --> 00:30:15,872
He's sticking his neck out for you!

290
00:30:18,283 --> 00:30:19,910
Thank you very much.

291
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:22,916
Good luck.

292
00:30:32,716 --> 00:30:35,347
Yubāba's offices are on the top floor.

293
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,449
Come on!

294
00:30:56,688 --> 00:30:58,122
You'll lose your nose doing that.

295
00:31:23,148 --> 00:31:24,445
There's another elevator after this.

296
00:31:24,683 --> 00:31:25,479
Okay.

297
00:31:30,222 --> 00:31:31,212
We're there.

298
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,091
Welcome, sir!

299
00:31:42,167 --> 00:31:43,328
My apologies, sir.

300
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:44,501
This elevator doesn't go any higher.

301
00:31:44,770 --> 00:31:46,499
There should be another nearby.

302
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:09,859
He's following us...

303
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:11,687
Keep your eyes to yourself.

304
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:29,039
And we've arrived!

305
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:36,553
Yours is the first parlor on the right.

306
00:32:39,389 --> 00:32:40,066
Rin!

307
00:32:40,292 --> 00:32:41,521
Yes sir!

308
00:32:43,161 --> 00:32:44,788
Don't you smell that?

309
00:32:45,564 --> 00:32:47,692
Human! You reek like a human!

310
00:32:47,933 --> 00:32:48,764
How could that be?

311
00:32:49,601 --> 00:32:52,536
Oh no, I smell it. Something tasty...

312
00:32:53,371 --> 00:32:55,567
What are you hiding?

313
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:57,898
Fess up! What've you got?

314
00:32:58,276 --> 00:32:59,402
You got me... it's this.

315
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:01,240
A blackchar...

316
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:02,140
Give it!

317
00:33:02,581 --> 00:33:03,412
No way!

318
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:05,673
The sisters had me pick this up special.

319
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,919
I'm begging you, just a little bite!

320
00:33:10,088 --> 00:33:11,419
Sir, just pull the lever

321
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:12,919
to reach the higher floors!

322
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,296
Ever heard of knocking?

323
00:35:01,066 --> 00:35:04,036
No manners at all. Were you raised in a barn?

324
00:35:14,245 --> 00:35:16,213
Well, come in.

325
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,549
Now, kid!

326
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:38,497
Oww...

327
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,613
Pipe down, I'm writing.

328
00:36:10,702 --> 00:36:11,601
Um...

329
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:14,102
Please let me work here.

330
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:25,748
That's the dumbest thing I've heard all week.

331
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:29,113
What use would you be? You're all skin and bones.

332
00:36:29,654 --> 00:36:33,750
This is nowhere for a human to be.

333
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,188
Every god and spirit in the land comes here

334
00:36:37,462 --> 00:36:41,126
to rest their weary souls.

335
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:45,297
And don't get me started about your parents!

336
00:36:45,570 --> 00:36:46,799
Gorging themselves on food for my customers.

337
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,972
No better than pigs!

338
00:36:49,207 --> 00:36:51,107
They got what they deserved.

339
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,470
And you.

340
00:36:55,013 --> 00:36:56,947
You're never going home.

341
00:37:00,885 --> 00:37:03,718
Might as well turn you into a piglet now.

342
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:06,786
Or perhaps a lump of coal?

343
00:37:14,699 --> 00:37:16,167
You're trembling.

344
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:19,904
I should congratulate you for making it this far.

345
00:37:20,171 --> 00:37:23,436
You must have had some help...

346
00:37:23,808 --> 00:37:25,674
...and that person deserves a reward, don't you think?

347
00:37:25,977 --> 00:37:30,414
Tell me who it was.

348
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,016
I want to work here!

349
00:37:35,353 --> 00:37:36,684
I said no!

350
00:37:36,988 --> 00:37:38,319
Please give me a job!

351
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:43,355
Never...!

352
00:37:47,332 --> 00:37:48,493
Why on earth

353
00:37:48,733 --> 00:37:50,997
should I give you of all people a job?

354
00:37:51,236 --> 00:37:55,332
Look at you! A spoiled, lazy, cry-baby!

355
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,769
You think there's work around here

356
00:37:58,042 --> 00:38:00,534
for a stupid little brat like you?

357
00:38:00,779 --> 00:38:02,713
No means no!

358
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:04,540
One more freeloader under this roof

359
00:38:04,849 --> 00:38:06,578
and I'll go out of business!

360
00:38:07,485 --> 00:38:08,714
Or maybe...

361
00:38:08,987 --> 00:38:13,549
...maybe I'll stick you in the worst position I can find

362
00:38:13,858 --> 00:38:18,955
and watch you work yourself to death?

363
00:38:31,576 --> 00:38:34,477
Oh no, oh my...

364
00:38:35,747 --> 00:38:38,079
Be good sweetie, I'll be right there...

365
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:41,275
What are you still doing there? Leave already!

366
00:38:41,686 --> 00:38:43,245
I said I want a job!

367
00:38:43,822 --> 00:38:46,382
Keep your voice down!

368
00:38:47,192 --> 00:38:50,719
Oh sweetums, don't be like that...

369
00:38:51,796 --> 00:38:54,356
What a perfect little baby...

370
00:38:54,732 --> 00:38:56,598
I'm not leaving until you say yes!

371
00:38:57,068 --> 00:38:59,230
Fine! Fine! Just be quiet!

372
00:39:00,104 --> 00:39:04,439
Ahh, there there...

373
00:39:24,662 --> 00:39:26,130
Your contract.

374
00:39:27,332 --> 00:39:29,130
Sign the dotted line.

375
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:31,433
You're hired.

376
00:39:32,170 --> 00:39:33,638
But if I hear even one complaint

377
00:39:33,938 --> 00:39:34,962
one whimper out of you

378
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,538
you'll be eating slop out of a bucket like your parents!

379
00:39:38,509 --> 00:39:40,477
I sign it here?

380
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:42,407
Yes, and hurry it up!

381
00:39:42,614 --> 00:39:44,048
I don't have all night.

382
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,948
I was a fool.

383
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:54,050
I never should have sworn that oath...

384
00:39:55,660 --> 00:39:58,994
...to hand out a job to any passerby who wants one!

385
00:40:01,266 --> 00:40:02,233
Done yet?

386
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,162
Yes...

387
00:40:07,205 --> 00:40:09,572
Your name is Chihiro?

388
00:40:09,774 --> 00:40:10,434
Yes, ma'am.

389
00:40:10,775 --> 00:40:13,005
That's too good a name for you.

390
00:40:22,987 --> 00:40:25,615
From this moment forward your name is Sen.

391
00:40:26,224 --> 00:40:27,692
Got it, Sen?

392
00:40:28,126 --> 00:40:29,924
Answer me when I call your name, Sen!

393
00:40:30,194 --> 00:40:31,684
Yes, ma'am!

394
00:40:32,397 --> 00:40:33,523
You summoned me?

395
00:40:36,801 --> 00:40:39,998
This kid's our newest hire. Get her fixed up with the girls.

396
00:40:40,238 --> 00:40:41,000
Understood.

397
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:42,873
What is your name?

398
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:46,642
My name is Sen.

399
00:40:47,078 --> 00:40:49,046
This way, Sen.

400
00:40:57,722 --> 00:40:58,917
Haku, I...

401
00:40:59,424 --> 00:41:00,892
Who said you could speak?

402
00:41:01,192 --> 00:41:03,217
And you will refer to me as Haku-sama.

403
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:20,604
The mistress's order it may be...

404
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:22,302
...but a human, here?

405
00:41:22,513 --> 00:41:24,072
Out of the question.

406
00:41:24,749 --> 00:41:25,978
She has signed a contract.

407
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:26,878
You're kidding.

408
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,450
I promise to do my best.

409
00:41:28,786 --> 00:41:30,720
They better not send her our way...

410
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,218
She reeks that human stench!

411
00:41:32,924 --> 00:41:34,255
Three days with our food

412
00:41:34,525 --> 00:41:35,754
and her smell will clear.

413
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,587
If she's still of no use to you

414
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,264
then fry her or boil her, it's up to you.

415
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,231
Now back to work!
Where is Rin?

416
00:41:44,435 --> 00:41:46,733
What? You're sticking her with me?

417
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,439
You wanted an understudy.

418
00:41:48,673 --> 00:41:51,005
Oh, Rin is just perfect for this.

419
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,075
Go, Sen.

420
00:41:53,311 --> 00:41:54,244
Yes, sir!

421
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,444
I don't believe this!

422
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,307
You guys owe me one.

423
00:41:58,883 --> 00:41:59,941
Get going.

424
00:42:02,954 --> 00:42:03,944
Come on!

425
00:42:13,131 --> 00:42:14,292
Kid, you did it!

426
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,232
You're a bit of a wimp, so I was worried.

427
00:42:17,702 --> 00:42:18,635
Stay sharp around here.

428
00:42:18,870 --> 00:42:20,770
You come to me if you've got a problem, okay?

429
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,739
What's wrong?

430
00:42:25,843 --> 00:42:27,607
My legs won't stop shaking.

431
00:42:32,250 --> 00:42:34,218
This is where we sleep.

432
00:42:35,453 --> 00:42:37,444
Dinner and a good night's sleep and you'll feel better.

433
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:42,785
Here's your smock. Gotta wash it yourself.

434
00:42:42,994 --> 00:42:43,825
Leggings.

435
00:42:44,829 --> 00:42:46,490
Is any of this going to fit you...?

436
00:42:47,765 --> 00:42:48,789
Too big.

437
00:42:51,235 --> 00:42:52,498
Rin-san?

438
00:42:52,804 --> 00:42:53,669
Yeah?

439
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,962
Are there two people named Haku here?

440
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,298
Two of 'em?

441
00:42:57,542 --> 00:42:59,670
One is quite enough, thank you very much.

442
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:01,173
Still too big.

443
00:43:01,446 --> 00:43:02,675
He's Yubāba's right-hand-man.

444
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:03,913
Watch yourself around him.

445
00:43:07,485 --> 00:43:08,509
There's gotta be one in here...

446
00:43:10,521 --> 00:43:12,353
Finally found one!

447
00:43:13,124 --> 00:43:15,855
Hey, what's the matter now?

448
00:43:16,194 --> 00:43:17,821
Hang in there, kid.

449
00:43:18,830 --> 00:43:21,197
Will you two keep it down?

450
00:43:21,466 --> 00:43:23,935
The new girl's not feeling good.

451
00:44:55,860 --> 00:44:57,453
Meet me at the bridge.

452
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,528
I'll take you to your parents.

453
00:45:44,442 --> 00:45:45,432
Where are my shoes?

454
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,019
Thanks.

455
00:47:10,027 --> 00:47:10,823
This way.

456
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:56,430
Dad! Mom! It's me!

457
00:47:56,674 --> 00:47:58,733
It's me, Sen!

458
00:47:59,577 --> 00:48:01,705
Mom! Dad!

459
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,948
Are they okay? Are they sick?

460
00:48:07,184 --> 00:48:09,744
They're fine, just sleeping off all the food.

461
00:48:10,588 --> 00:48:13,319
Right now they don't even know they were human.

462
00:48:18,929 --> 00:48:20,192
Dad, Mom,

463
00:48:20,398 --> 00:48:21,490
I'm going to get you out of here!

464
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:22,893
Don't eat too much

465
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:24,727
or they're going to cook you!

466
00:48:33,077 --> 00:48:34,670
Hide these somewhere safe.

467
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:38,874
I thought they threw them out.

468
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:41,007
You'll need them when you leave this place.

469
00:48:47,525 --> 00:48:49,516
The card I got at my farewell party...

470
00:48:53,130 --> 00:48:55,929
Chihiro... that's my name!

471
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:59,635
Yubāba controls others by seizing their true names.

472
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:01,530
You'll be Sen on the surface

473
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:04,467
with your true name spirited away within your heart.

474
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,367
She almost had me.

475
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,874
I was almost Sen for real.

476
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:09,705
If you lose your name

477
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,245
you'll never find your way back home.

478
00:49:13,083 --> 00:49:15,381
I have forgotten mine.

479
00:49:15,786 --> 00:49:17,379
Your real name?

480
00:49:17,822 --> 00:49:20,917
But it's strange, I remember you so clearly.

481
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:25,957
Here. You haven't eaten yet, right?

482
00:49:26,297 --> 00:49:27,458
I'm not hungry.

483
00:49:28,032 --> 00:49:29,056
I made these just for you.

484
00:49:29,300 --> 00:49:32,031
There's a charm on them to cheer you up.

485
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:10,736
I know. Here, finish the rest.

486
00:50:26,123 --> 00:50:27,284
Know the way back by now?

487
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,960
Yup. Thanks Haku, I feel much better.

488
00:52:04,822 --> 00:52:07,621
Where the heck were you?
Nearly gave me a heart attack.

489
00:52:07,825 --> 00:52:08,849
Sorry!

490
00:52:18,202 --> 00:52:19,567
Out of the way.

491
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,045
Sen, squeeze that thing like you mean it!

492
00:52:35,653 --> 00:52:38,179
Rin, Sen, you're up for the Big Tub.

493
00:52:38,455 --> 00:52:40,423
What! That's frog's work!

494
00:52:40,691 --> 00:52:43,683
Orders from the Foreman.
And no cutting corners!

495
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:05,711
Aren't you getting wet?

496
00:53:09,953 --> 00:53:11,284
Sen, hurry it up!

497
00:53:11,588 --> 00:53:12,612
Be right there!

498
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:14,754
I'll leave this open for you.

499
00:53:42,753 --> 00:53:43,720
Rin, you got the Big Tub?

500
00:53:43,921 --> 00:53:44,615
Screw off.

501
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:50,823
When was the last time they cleaned this?

502
00:54:06,009 --> 00:54:09,070
They give this tub to the dirtiest customers.

503
00:54:09,279 --> 00:54:10,940
Man, is this ever caked on...

504
00:54:11,348 --> 00:54:13,680
Rin, Sen, we're opening soon.

505
00:54:14,017 --> 00:54:15,485
Yes sir, almost ready.

506
00:54:15,719 --> 00:54:17,687
I knew they'd pull something like this.

507
00:54:17,955 --> 00:54:19,013
We need to rinse this down with Cure Water.

508
00:54:19,289 --> 00:54:21,018
Sen, run to the concierge and grab a tag.

509
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,281
A tag?

510
00:54:25,295 --> 00:54:26,854
It needs to be for Cure Water, got it?

511
00:54:27,197 --> 00:54:28,164
Got it...

512
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,292
Rin-san, what's a concierge?

513
00:54:35,672 --> 00:54:38,073
What's that? Something's coming.

514
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:48,084
Thought you could fool me?

515
00:54:48,352 --> 00:54:51,219
I feel you slinking around in the rain, whatever you are.

516
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:17,937
What? Not a chance!

517
00:55:18,182 --> 00:55:19,741
Good morning, ma'am!

518
00:55:20,417 --> 00:55:22,215
I hope your sleep was a pleasant one.

519
00:55:22,853 --> 00:55:23,752
For Kasuga-sama.

520
00:55:24,021 --> 00:55:25,887
Yes, ma'am! One top-line sulfur bath.

521
00:55:26,590 --> 00:55:28,922
Look kid, no means no. Get back to work!

522
00:55:29,393 --> 00:55:30,827
Scrape it down yourself, the old fashioned way!

523
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:32,721
Good morning!

524
00:55:33,096 --> 00:55:33,927
You hear me? By hand!

525
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,256
Yeah but...

526
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,261
She told me it has to be Cure Water...

527
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,094
I'm not going to tell you again.

528
00:55:39,369 --> 00:55:41,269
A mugwort bath? But of course!

529
00:55:41,572 --> 00:55:43,267
Enjoy the water.

530
00:55:52,482 --> 00:55:53,574
Concierge speaking.

531
00:55:53,784 --> 00:55:55,843
Ah, yes ma'am!

532
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:58,351
Thank you very much!

533
00:55:58,555 --> 00:55:59,579
Wait a minute!

534
00:55:59,823 --> 00:56:01,120
Get back here!

535
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:02,120
What's the matter?

536
00:56:02,392 --> 00:56:03,621
Ah... nothing to worry about, Mistress.

537
00:56:04,294 --> 00:56:05,625
Something's coming, keep an eye out.

538
00:56:05,829 --> 00:56:06,591
More humans?

539
00:56:06,797 --> 00:56:08,128
You're going to find out.

540
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:09,763
Haku is off on other duties.

541
00:56:10,133 --> 00:56:12,295
Whoa, how'd you convince him to give you this?

542
00:56:12,536 --> 00:56:14,971
These go straight to Kamajī.

543
00:56:16,707 --> 00:56:18,436
We're not busy yet so we should get it pretty quick.

544
00:56:24,615 --> 00:56:27,312
Pull the rope and voilà. Give it a shot.

545
00:56:36,293 --> 00:56:38,318
You're seriously a klutz.

546
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,563
Why's it that colour?

547
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:43,095
This one's enriched with dried worm extract.

548
00:56:43,767 --> 00:56:44,632
With the water this murky

549
00:56:44,868 --> 00:56:46,632
they'll never know we didn't scrub it.

550
00:56:48,338 --> 00:56:51,153
Once the tub fills, pull the rope again
to stop the water.

551
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:53,506
You don't have to hold onto it.

552
00:56:53,810 --> 00:56:55,335
I'll go grab us breakfast.

553
00:56:55,579 --> 00:56:56,671
Okay.

554
00:57:25,275 --> 00:57:27,767
The tub's not ready yet...

555
00:57:33,617 --> 00:57:34,880
Where'd you get all these?

556
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:39,517
They're for me?

557
00:57:42,726 --> 00:57:45,161
Sorry, I don't need any more.

558
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:49,658
No, I only needed one!

559
00:58:04,681 --> 00:58:05,375
Mistress!

560
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:06,912
A Rot Demon?

561
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:09,152
Yes, and a massive one!

562
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,909
I'm almost to the bridge!

563
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:13,418
Please turn back! Please sir, no further!

564
00:58:13,657 --> 00:58:16,251
Please turn back!

565
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:19,928
Please, sir!

566
00:58:20,597 --> 00:58:21,996
The stench...

567
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,595
That's odd.

568
00:58:24,901 --> 00:58:27,233
I could have sworn it wasn't a Rot Demon I felt.

569
00:58:27,471 --> 00:58:29,872
No matter, he's here now. Let him in!

570
00:58:30,741 --> 00:58:32,072
All we can do now

571
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:34,004
is bathe him and get him out of here as soon as possible.

572
00:58:35,245 --> 00:58:38,374
Please everyone, this way! The Rot Demon approaches!

573
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:42,281
Rin, Sen, get out here! The Mistress wants you.

574
00:58:42,586 --> 00:58:43,382
Right away!

575
00:58:43,720 --> 00:58:46,121
Alright kid, it's time to test your mettle.

576
00:58:46,423 --> 00:58:49,120
We're sending this customer to you in the Big Tub, got it?

577
00:58:49,326 --> 00:58:50,020
But...

578
00:58:50,227 --> 00:58:52,127
Want to be turned into coal? No back-talk!

579
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:53,122
Do you understand me?

580
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:55,092
He's here...!

581
00:59:05,709 --> 00:59:07,677
Stop that, you'll offend the customer!

582
00:59:15,819 --> 00:59:19,221
Welcome... to our... fine establishment...

583
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,459
Ah, payment?

584
00:59:24,694 --> 00:59:27,129
Sen... Sen! Take the nice customer's money.

585
00:59:27,364 --> 00:59:28,490
Yes, ma'am!

586
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:38,671
What are you doing?

587
00:59:38,909 --> 00:59:41,401
Show this fine sir to his bath!

588
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,077
This way, sir...

589
01:00:11,475 --> 01:00:12,408
The food!

590
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,543
Open the windows! All of them!

591
01:00:59,302 --> 01:01:00,483
Just a second!

592
01:01:04,895 --> 01:01:07,091
Look at all that muck.

593
01:01:07,397 --> 01:01:08,922
This is no laughing matter.

594
01:01:09,166 --> 01:01:10,600
What's she going to do?

595
01:01:15,405 --> 01:01:17,499
Ah, she wants to refill the tub.

596
01:01:17,741 --> 01:01:21,336
She's getting her muddy handprints all over the wall...

597
01:01:33,223 --> 01:01:35,692
What? Who gave her more tags?

598
01:01:35,959 --> 01:01:38,291
Don't look at me!

599
01:02:19,836 --> 01:02:22,362
Ah... such expensive Cure Water...

600
01:02:48,498 --> 01:02:50,364
Sen! Sen, where are you?

601
01:02:50,934 --> 01:02:51,696
Rin-san!

602
01:02:51,968 --> 01:02:53,026
You okay?

603
01:02:53,270 --> 01:02:54,829
I just talked to Kamajī.

604
01:02:55,071 --> 01:02:55,867
He's going to give us all the water he's got!

605
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:58,507
He's going to use his best herbs!

606
01:02:59,009 --> 01:02:59,703
Thanks!

607
01:03:00,010 --> 01:03:02,035
There's something stuck in his side!

608
01:03:02,345 --> 01:03:03,210
What?

609
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:04,879
It's too deep, I can't pull it out.

610
01:03:05,348 --> 01:03:07,510
Something stuck?

611
01:03:07,751 --> 01:03:10,379
Get everyone to the main floor.

612
01:03:10,587 --> 01:03:11,247
Ma'am?

613
01:03:11,454 --> 01:03:12,387
Hurry!

614
01:03:15,659 --> 01:03:17,058
Sen, Rin!

615
01:03:17,294 --> 01:03:19,524
That's no Rot Demon!

616
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,059
Use this rope!

617
01:03:23,466 --> 01:03:24,399
Got it!

618
01:03:33,443 --> 01:03:34,569
Hold on tight!

619
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:35,743
Okay!

620
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:37,914
Hurry it up, you slackers.

621
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:39,741
The women too, grab the rope!

622
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:41,747
We're ready!

623
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:46,255
Alright everybody, all together!

624
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:05,406
A bike?

625
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:07,038
I knew it.

626
01:04:07,377 --> 01:04:09,277
Almost there! Keep pulling!

627
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,349
Sen! You okay?

628
01:04:56,626 --> 01:04:59,357
Well done.

629
01:05:28,892 --> 01:05:30,018
Gold!

630
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,519
That's property of the bathhouse! Hands off!

631
01:05:33,730 --> 01:05:34,788
Quiet, all of you!

632
01:05:34,998 --> 01:05:37,023
The customer's still here!

633
01:05:43,173 --> 01:05:46,040
Sen, you're in his way. Come down.

634
01:05:46,309 --> 01:05:48,744
Open the gate! He's leaving!

635
01:06:15,605 --> 01:06:19,405
You wonderful girl, we're rich!

636
01:06:20,477 --> 01:06:22,741
That was a river god of some repute.

637
01:06:23,112 --> 01:06:24,705
Follow Sen's example, everyone!

638
01:06:25,482 --> 01:06:27,246
You're all getting a bonus for this.

639
01:06:27,917 --> 01:06:30,318
Now cough up all that gold you picked up!

640
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:45,929
Hungry? I swiped these from the kitchens.

641
01:06:46,769 --> 01:06:47,930
Sure!

642
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,400
What a night...

643
01:06:52,876 --> 01:06:54,173
I wonder where Haku is.

644
01:06:54,444 --> 01:06:56,105
That guy, again?

645
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:59,408
He's gone from time to time.

646
01:07:00,083 --> 01:07:01,346
Apparently Yubāba sends him off

647
01:07:01,618 --> 01:07:03,609
to do her dirty work.

648
01:07:03,953 --> 01:07:04,613
Really?

649
01:07:04,921 --> 01:07:06,116
Lights out, Rin!

650
01:07:32,749 --> 01:07:35,150
Where did an ocean come from?

651
01:07:35,418 --> 01:07:36,317
You're surprised?

652
01:07:36,586 --> 01:07:38,418
It rains, you get an ocean. That's that.

653
01:07:40,456 --> 01:07:42,049
I'm going to reach that town over there one day.

654
01:07:42,325 --> 01:07:44,293
I can't wait to quit this place.

655
01:08:07,884 --> 01:08:09,852
What's wrong?

656
01:08:39,616 --> 01:08:41,050
Gold!

657
01:08:44,087 --> 01:08:46,920
You're no customer. What are you doing in there?

658
01:08:47,156 --> 01:08:48,851
Get out of there right this minute!

659
01:08:55,365 --> 01:08:56,730
More gold!

660
01:08:57,066 --> 01:08:58,556
I can have this?

661
01:09:04,073 --> 01:09:06,132
You can... make gold?

662
01:09:11,547 --> 01:09:12,639
Gimme!

663
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,717
I can hear you back there, whoever you are.

664
01:09:23,826 --> 01:09:26,056
What are you messing around back here for after dark?

665
01:09:29,799 --> 01:09:32,769
Right on schedule - I'm starving.

666
01:09:33,036 --> 01:09:33,935
I said I'm hungry!

667
01:09:34,203 --> 01:09:35,261
That voice...

668
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:37,098
I'll even pay upfront.

669
01:09:38,074 --> 01:09:40,600
Wasn't I clear? I'm famished and I want a bath!

670
01:09:40,877 --> 01:09:42,276
Wake everyone up!

671
01:09:47,984 --> 01:09:49,008
Dad, Mom.

672
01:09:49,285 --> 01:09:51,253
I got some special medicine from a river god!

673
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:54,013
You'll turn back into a human if you eat this!

674
01:09:58,394 --> 01:10:00,123
Dad, Mom, where are you?

675
01:10:00,797 --> 01:10:01,787
Dad!

676
01:10:13,342 --> 01:10:14,241
Just a bad dream.

677
01:10:21,250 --> 01:10:22,547
Where is everybody?

678
01:10:29,392 --> 01:10:31,827
Wow, it really is an ocean.

679
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:40,062
I can even see the barns from here.

680
01:10:44,073 --> 01:10:45,837
Kamajī's already boiling water?

681
01:10:46,142 --> 01:10:48,167
I must have really overslept.

682
01:10:51,748 --> 01:10:52,840
The customer is waiting!

683
01:10:53,116 --> 01:10:54,675
Hurry it up! As fast as you can!

684
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:56,850
Haul out all the leftovers, I don't care!

685
01:10:57,153 --> 01:10:58,678
Whatever you've got back there!

686
01:11:03,126 --> 01:11:05,686
I was just coming to wake you up. Look at this!

687
01:11:06,195 --> 01:11:08,289
Gold. Real gold!

688
01:11:08,731 --> 01:11:10,790
There's a high-roller here giving massive tips.

689
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:24,877
Bring me all you got, I'm still starving!

690
01:11:29,986 --> 01:11:31,181
Where did he come from?

691
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:32,315
Who cares? Follow me!

692
01:11:32,455 --> 01:11:34,981
We gotta grab what we can while Yubāba's still asleep!

693
01:11:35,391 --> 01:11:37,189
But I have to go see Kamajī...

694
01:11:37,894 --> 01:11:39,885
I wouldn't if I were you.

695
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:42,224
He's in a terrible mood 'cause of all this.

696
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:43,398
Rin, let's go get more.

697
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:10,587
What am I going to do

698
01:12:10,893 --> 01:12:12,987
if I can't tell them apart from the other pigs?

699
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:16,664
I hope Dad hasn't gotten any fatter...

700
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:46,159
It's that dragon I saw before...

701
01:12:46,762 --> 01:12:47,957
He's coming this way!

702
01:12:51,033 --> 01:12:52,228
What are those? They're not birds.

703
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:05,613
Hang in there, Haku!

704
01:13:05,848 --> 01:13:06,610
Fly this way!

705
01:13:27,670 --> 01:13:29,832
It's just paper.

706
01:13:58,334 --> 01:14:00,200
You're Haku, aren't you?

707
01:14:06,676 --> 01:14:07,700
Are you hurt?

708
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:09,708
Those weird paper birds are gone now.

709
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:11,204
You're safe.

710
01:14:24,460 --> 01:14:26,224
He's heading to Yubāba's rooms...

711
01:14:26,896 --> 01:14:29,263
He's going to die if I don't help him.

712
01:14:37,073 --> 01:14:37,733
One, two!

713
01:14:37,974 --> 01:14:41,239
Gracing us with his magnificent presence

714
01:14:41,978 --> 01:14:45,881
the Great Giver! Come one and all!

715
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,745
Welcome to our bathhouse!

716
01:14:49,051 --> 01:14:53,181
Let us bask in his generosity!

717
01:14:57,593 --> 01:14:58,219
He's almost here!

718
01:14:58,427 --> 01:14:59,360
I gotta grab some this time.

719
01:14:59,562 --> 01:15:01,394
I hear he just pours it from his hands!

720
01:15:02,431 --> 01:15:05,423
Great Giver! Please, turn this way!

721
01:15:09,472 --> 01:15:10,735
Hey, where are you going?

722
01:15:10,973 --> 01:15:11,735
I need to go up!

723
01:15:11,974 --> 01:15:13,942
Not a chance!

724
01:15:14,877 --> 01:15:15,901
Blood!

725
01:15:20,016 --> 01:15:22,075
You're in our customer's way. Move it!

726
01:15:23,753 --> 01:15:25,517
Thank you for helping me yesterday.

727
01:15:25,955 --> 01:15:28,117
I said get out of the w-

728
01:15:50,379 --> 01:15:51,847
I don't need any of that.

729
01:15:54,917 --> 01:15:56,976
I'm sorry, I have to go.

730
01:16:08,831 --> 01:16:11,630
Back! Get back, all of you!

731
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,732
Out of the way!

732
01:16:14,570 --> 01:16:16,334
Sir, please forgive her rude behaviour.

733
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,803
She's just a human child, she doesn't know any better.

734
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,512
You laughing at me?

735
01:16:24,613 --> 01:16:25,512
You laughed.

736
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:27,273
I would never!

737
01:19:15,050 --> 01:19:17,678
I'm out for one morning and look what I come back to!

738
01:19:18,621 --> 01:19:20,521
It's a No-Face.

739
01:19:20,756 --> 01:19:22,690
You heard me, a No-Face!

740
01:19:23,058 --> 01:19:24,355
Look at you. It throws some money at you

741
01:19:24,627 --> 01:19:25,890
and you fall at its feet like dogs!

742
01:19:26,195 --> 01:19:27,026
I'm on my way down.

743
01:19:27,296 --> 01:19:29,424
Don't do anything until I get there.

744
01:19:30,466 --> 01:19:32,696
Look at this, you've ruined my rug.

745
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:33,993
Get him out of my sight.

746
01:19:35,304 --> 01:19:37,898
We have no further use for him.

747
01:19:59,695 --> 01:20:02,392
Why aren't you sleeping in your bed, my baby boy?

748
01:20:06,635 --> 01:20:08,194
Sorry sweetie.

749
01:20:08,437 --> 01:20:10,565
I woke you from your nappy-wappy, didn't I.

750
01:20:10,873 --> 01:20:13,399
Mommy still have some things to take care of.

751
01:20:16,812 --> 01:20:19,076
You just go back to sleep.

752
01:20:47,376 --> 01:20:49,435
Let me go, that hurts!

753
01:20:49,912 --> 01:20:51,676
Thanks for not ratting me out.

754
01:20:51,980 --> 01:20:53,675
But I really need to go.

755
01:20:53,949 --> 01:20:55,110
Can you let me go?

756
01:20:55,351 --> 01:20:57,115
You're here to get me sick.

757
01:20:58,187 --> 01:21:00,656
I can't go outside, there's germs everywhere.

758
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:03,352
I'm a human.

759
01:21:03,625 --> 01:21:05,423
You've probably never seen one before, but...

760
01:21:05,728 --> 01:21:07,924
It's too dangerous outside.

761
01:21:08,163 --> 01:21:10,154
You're going to stay here and play with me forever.

762
01:21:10,566 --> 01:21:11,829
Are you sick?

763
01:21:12,034 --> 01:21:12,762
If I go outside

764
01:21:12,968 --> 01:21:14,868
I'll get sick, so I can't.

765
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,299
No, you're going to get sick if you stay in here!

766
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:18,468
Please listen.

767
01:21:18,741 --> 01:21:21,301
Someone really important to me is hurt.

768
01:21:21,543 --> 01:21:22,977
I have to go help him right now.

769
01:21:23,278 --> 01:21:24,575
Please, let go of my arm.

770
01:21:24,980 --> 01:21:26,311
If you go, I'm gonna cry!

771
01:21:26,615 --> 01:21:28,140
If I cry, my mom's gonna come

772
01:21:28,384 --> 01:21:29,977
and she'll kill you for sure!

773
01:21:30,319 --> 01:21:31,718
Don't make me break your arm.

774
01:21:31,987 --> 01:21:32,977
Ow, that's hurts!

775
01:21:33,288 --> 01:21:35,689
I promise I'll come back.

776
01:21:36,058 --> 01:21:37,321
No, we play right now!

777
01:21:41,630 --> 01:21:43,462
You see this? It's blood!

778
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:59,078
Get away from him!

779
01:21:59,348 --> 01:22:01,680
Haku? Haku, can you hear me?

780
01:22:02,484 --> 01:22:03,781
Leave us alone!

781
01:22:10,526 --> 01:22:11,322
Get away from me!

782
01:22:13,462 --> 01:22:14,930
No, stop!

783
01:22:30,546 --> 01:22:32,105
Blood doesn't scare me.

784
01:22:32,381 --> 01:22:34,042
I'm gonna cry if you don't play with me!

785
01:22:34,483 --> 01:22:36,178
I'll play with you later, I promise!

786
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:39,718
I'm gonna cry! I'll do it!

787
01:22:41,824 --> 01:22:42,882
Please, not now!

788
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:44,353
What a cry-baby.

789
01:22:44,593 --> 01:22:46,220
Stop with the fake tears, kid.

790
01:22:47,763 --> 01:22:50,232
You're getting a bit too fat.

791
01:22:58,006 --> 01:23:00,100
Still a bit see-through...

792
01:23:00,375 --> 01:23:01,103
Mommy?

793
01:23:01,844 --> 01:23:02,572
Not quite.

794
01:23:02,878 --> 01:23:05,643
Can't even tell I'm not your mother?

795
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,750
There, much less lard to lug around.

796
01:23:17,059 --> 01:23:20,222
Now what shall I do with you lot?

797
01:23:38,347 --> 01:23:40,008
This is our little secret.

798
01:23:40,282 --> 01:23:43,115
Tell anyone and you won't like the consequences.

799
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:45,787
Who are you?

800
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:48,349
Yubāba's twin sister.

801
01:23:48,624 --> 01:23:49,420
Thanks to you

802
01:23:49,658 --> 01:23:52,252
I was finally able to reach this place.

803
01:23:52,494 --> 01:23:54,394
Now hand over that dragon.

804
01:23:54,730 --> 01:23:56,858
He's hurt - what are you going to do to him?

805
01:23:57,432 --> 01:24:00,458
That dragon is a slave to my sister and a thief.

806
01:24:00,702 --> 01:24:03,501
He stole an important seal of mine,
and I'm taking it back.

807
01:24:03,705 --> 01:24:05,195
He wouldn't do that!

808
01:24:05,407 --> 01:24:06,499
He's a good person.

809
01:24:07,142 --> 01:24:08,803
All dragon's are kind.

810
01:24:09,044 --> 01:24:10,637
Kind, and foolish.

811
01:24:10,913 --> 01:24:12,813
He came crawling to my sister

812
01:24:13,081 --> 01:24:15,140
to get his hands on stronger magicks.

813
01:24:15,751 --> 01:24:19,312
And now he's servant to her greed.

814
01:24:19,588 --> 01:24:21,613
Now move.

815
01:24:21,857 --> 01:24:24,224
He's not long for this world anyway.

816
01:24:24,493 --> 01:24:27,530
There's a curse on that seal of mine.

817
01:24:27,696 --> 01:24:29,755
It kills anyone who tries to take it.

818
01:24:30,632 --> 01:24:31,690
No, he can't die!

819
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:41,809
Now what are you bunch up to?

820
01:24:42,044 --> 01:24:44,342
Cut that out and get back in the play room.

821
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:54,587
Ah... he got me again...

822
01:24:54,856 --> 01:24:57,188
Haku... no... wait!

823
01:25:46,775 --> 01:25:47,867
What on earth?

824
01:25:48,110 --> 01:25:49,737
Hey, hold on!

825
01:25:57,719 --> 01:25:59,084
Does it hurt?

826
01:26:02,824 --> 01:26:05,088
This is bad.

827
01:26:07,095 --> 01:26:08,256
Haku, hold on!

828
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:10,123
What do we do? He's going to die.

829
01:26:10,799 --> 01:26:13,427
There's something gnawing away at his insides.

830
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:14,567
Inside him?

831
01:26:14,803 --> 01:26:17,932
This is some powerful magic. Nothing I can do.

832
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:21,568
Haku, this is special medicine from a river god.

833
01:26:21,810 --> 01:26:23,778
It might help you.

834
01:26:26,348 --> 01:26:28,282
Haku, open your mouth!

835
01:26:28,817 --> 01:26:31,184
Haku, please eat it.

836
01:26:33,088 --> 01:26:34,783
Look, it's fine.

837
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:37,157
Is that a Bitter Ball?

838
01:26:37,492 --> 01:26:40,291
Open your mouth...

839
01:26:44,466 --> 01:26:47,197
You'll be fine. Now swallow!

840
01:27:06,088 --> 01:27:07,317
There! That's it!

841
01:27:20,235 --> 01:27:21,168
The seal!

842
01:27:21,536 --> 01:27:23,265
It's getting away!

843
01:27:43,058 --> 01:27:45,527
Sen! The curse is on you now, hold out your hands!

844
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:50,726
Begone!

845
01:27:50,932 --> 01:27:53,619
This seal belongs to Yubāba's older sister.

846
01:27:54,169 --> 01:27:56,661
Zenība? Must be her Contract Seal!

847
01:27:57,205 --> 01:27:59,105
How did he get his hands on that...

848
01:28:01,910 --> 01:28:03,708
I knew it was Haku!

849
01:28:04,012 --> 01:28:04,945
Look, it's Haku!

850
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:14,553
He's not breathing!

851
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:15,882
No, I think he is...

852
01:28:16,191 --> 01:28:18,250
These curses are nasty business.

853
01:28:27,769 --> 01:28:30,568
We've done all we can for now.

854
01:28:33,108 --> 01:28:34,234
You should know something.

855
01:28:34,476 --> 01:28:37,878
Haku appeared out of the blue one day,
just like you did.

856
01:28:38,113 --> 01:28:40,878
Said he wanted to become a sorcerer.

857
01:28:41,249 --> 01:28:43,081
I tried to convince him otherwise.

858
01:28:43,318 --> 01:28:46,754
Told him he didn't understand
what it meant to be a witch's apprentice.

859
01:28:47,489 --> 01:28:49,423
But he didn't listen.

860
01:28:50,158 --> 01:28:51,751
He said he had nowhere else to go

861
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:55,258
and in time became Yubāba's underling.

862
01:28:55,897 --> 01:28:59,060
I could tell it took a toll on him.

863
01:28:59,301 --> 01:29:01,929
You could see the burden in his eyes.

864
01:29:04,105 --> 01:29:05,903
I know what I have to do.

865
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:08,041
I need to take this back to Yubāba's sister.

866
01:29:08,343 --> 01:29:09,435
I'll apologize for Haku

867
01:29:09,711 --> 01:29:11,839
and ask her to heal him.

868
01:29:12,047 --> 01:29:13,776
Can you tell me where she is?

869
01:29:14,549 --> 01:29:16,608
Zenība's place?

870
01:29:17,152 --> 01:29:18,950
These witches aren't to be triffled with.

871
01:29:19,187 --> 01:29:19,915
Please!

872
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:22,282
Haku saved me once.

873
01:29:22,557 --> 01:29:24,025
Now it's my turn.

874
01:29:24,659 --> 01:29:27,185
I'm sure you could get there, but...

875
01:29:27,462 --> 01:29:30,955
The way back is the problem.

876
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:32,863
Wait a minute.

877
01:29:35,770 --> 01:29:38,933
I know they're around here somewhere...

878
01:29:39,708 --> 01:29:42,609
Hey guys, can you grab my clothes and shoes?

879
01:29:51,119 --> 01:29:53,816
Sen! I've been looking everywhere for you!

880
01:29:57,893 --> 01:30:00,487
What's Haku doing here? What's going on?

881
01:30:01,296 --> 01:30:02,195
And what are those little things?

882
01:30:03,431 --> 01:30:05,593
They're my new friends.

883
01:30:05,867 --> 01:30:07,232
Yubāba's going crazy up there.

884
01:30:07,435 --> 01:30:09,096
She's tearing up the place looking for you.

885
01:30:09,304 --> 01:30:10,794
Turns out that high-roller up there

886
01:30:11,039 --> 01:30:12,837
was actually one of those No-Face creatures.

887
01:30:13,375 --> 01:30:16,310
And she's convinced you're the one who let it in!

888
01:30:19,294 --> 01:30:20,241
Maybe I did.

889
01:30:20,615 --> 01:30:22,515
What! Are you serious!

890
01:30:22,784 --> 01:30:24,343
I thought he was a customer...

891
01:30:24,586 --> 01:30:25,246
Well, now what?

892
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:27,648
That thing has eaten three of the staff!

893
01:30:28,223 --> 01:30:30,692
Found 'em! Sen, here!

894
01:30:31,626 --> 01:30:33,094
Come on Jī-san, not now.

895
01:30:33,361 --> 01:30:34,851
You can use these.

896
01:30:36,398 --> 01:30:37,331
Train tickets?

897
01:30:37,565 --> 01:30:39,033
Where'd you get your hands on those?

898
01:30:39,301 --> 01:30:41,668
They're leftovers from forty years ago.

899
01:30:41,903 --> 01:30:43,837
Listen. You're going to ride the train to the sixth stop.

900
01:30:44,072 --> 01:30:45,471
The station is "Swamp Bottom".

901
01:30:45,874 --> 01:30:46,864
Swamp Bottom?

902
01:30:47,108 --> 01:30:48,872
Right. The sixth stop, got it?

903
01:30:49,110 --> 01:30:49,872
Sixth stop.

904
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,708
Don't get it wrong.

905
01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:54,005
There used to be a return train

906
01:30:54,249 --> 01:30:55,876
but these days it's out-bound only.

907
01:30:56,184 --> 01:30:57,618
Still up to it?

908
01:30:57,953 --> 01:31:01,014
I'll be okay. I'll walk the tracks on the way back.

909
01:31:02,991 --> 01:31:04,516
What about Yubāba?

910
01:31:04,759 --> 01:31:06,056
I'll deal with her then go.

911
01:31:06,828 --> 01:31:08,956
Haku, I promise I'll be back soon.

912
01:31:09,164 --> 01:31:10,563
Don't die on me.

913
01:31:11,366 --> 01:31:12,891
Seriously, what is going on?

914
01:31:13,535 --> 01:31:15,902
Don't you see? It's love.

915
01:31:23,578 --> 01:31:25,512
Oh gods, it's huge!

916
01:31:25,714 --> 01:31:26,374
Gross.

917
01:31:26,581 --> 01:31:27,742
I don't want to get eaten!

918
01:31:28,016 --> 01:31:28,744
It's her.

919
01:31:36,624 --> 01:31:37,887
Sen? Finally.

920
01:31:38,093 --> 01:31:40,755
The Mitress is doing her best,
but the creature is at wit's end.

921
01:31:43,665 --> 01:31:45,326
My dear customer, there's no need for such tantrums.

922
01:31:45,600 --> 01:31:46,931
Sen is on her way right now.

923
01:31:47,902 --> 01:31:50,234
Then where is she? Bring her to me right now!

924
01:31:50,705 --> 01:31:51,934
In you go.

925
01:31:57,779 --> 01:31:59,440
Mitress, she's here.

926
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:00,772
About damn time!

927
01:32:01,216 --> 01:32:03,184
Sir, wonderful news, Sen is here!

928
01:32:03,451 --> 01:32:05,180
One moment while I get her ready for you.

929
01:32:06,755 --> 01:32:08,245
Just where the hell were you!

930
01:32:08,490 --> 01:32:09,616
That thing is tearing this place apart!

931
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:10,789
Now you're going to get in there

932
01:32:11,026 --> 01:32:12,755
and milk that monstrosity for every gram of...

933
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,756
What's a rat doing in here?

934
01:32:20,869 --> 01:32:22,963
You don't recognize him?

935
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:26,099
Why would I? Rodents, yuck.

936
01:32:26,441 --> 01:32:27,465
Now get in there!

937
01:32:29,310 --> 01:32:31,210
At your leisure, good sir.

938
01:32:32,447 --> 01:32:34,711
Is she going to be alright in there?

939
01:32:34,983 --> 01:32:36,007
Want to trade places with her?

940
01:32:57,405 --> 01:33:00,340
Want some of this? It's fantastic.

941
01:33:02,477 --> 01:33:03,842
I know, how about some gold!

942
01:33:04,045 --> 01:33:04,841
They're all begging me for it

943
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,775
but I've decided it's all for you.

944
01:33:10,885 --> 01:33:12,182
Now come closer.

945
01:33:12,720 --> 01:33:16,281
Just tell me what you want and it's yours.

946
01:33:16,791 --> 01:33:18,418
Where did you come from?

947
01:33:18,793 --> 01:33:21,023
There's something I really have to do, I can't stay.

948
01:33:23,565 --> 01:33:25,863
You should go home.

949
01:33:26,201 --> 01:33:27,032
There is something I want

950
01:33:27,335 --> 01:33:28,860
but it's not something you could ever give me.

951
01:33:31,106 --> 01:33:32,039
Where is your home?

952
01:33:32,307 --> 01:33:33,900
Don't you have a dad or a mom?

953
01:33:34,976 --> 01:33:37,877
Don't... say any more...

954
01:33:39,214 --> 01:33:42,775
Alone... so alone...

955
01:33:43,852 --> 01:33:45,081
You don't know where you're from?

956
01:33:45,553 --> 01:33:48,716
I want... I want you...

957
01:33:49,791 --> 01:33:50,758
Take my gold!

958
01:33:51,593 --> 01:33:52,458
You're going to eat me?

959
01:33:52,660 --> 01:33:53,525
Take it!

960
01:33:53,728 --> 01:33:54,388
Take it!

961
01:34:03,872 --> 01:34:06,364
If you're going to eat me, then eat this first.

962
01:34:07,308 --> 01:34:08,469
I was saving it for my dad and mom

963
01:34:08,743 --> 01:34:10,905
but I think you need it more.

964
01:34:35,837 --> 01:34:39,102
What did you make me swallow...!

965
01:34:54,856 --> 01:34:55,948
Everyone out of the way!

966
01:34:57,292 --> 01:34:59,021
Customer or not, that's far enough!

967
01:35:12,674 --> 01:35:13,937
Over here!

968
01:35:14,842 --> 01:35:15,809
I'm here!

969
01:36:00,855 --> 01:36:01,981
Unforgiveable...

970
01:36:20,074 --> 01:36:21,872
Sen! Down here!

971
01:36:38,526 --> 01:36:40,551
It's him. Hey! Down here!

972
01:36:40,828 --> 01:36:42,227
You nuts? You want it to chase us?

973
01:36:46,434 --> 01:36:48,300
Being in there was what made him crazy.

974
01:36:48,569 --> 01:36:49,866
We have to lead him away.

975
01:36:50,104 --> 01:36:52,129
And just where are we leading it?

976
01:36:52,407 --> 01:36:53,135
I'm not sure yet...

977
01:36:53,408 --> 01:36:54,637
You never had a plan?

978
01:36:55,276 --> 01:36:57,870
Great, here it comes.

979
01:37:15,530 --> 01:37:16,429
You can walk it from here.

980
01:37:17,699 --> 01:37:19,258
He says you'll know the station when you see it.

981
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,725
Thanks.

982
01:37:21,636 --> 01:37:23,104
You better come back!

983
01:37:29,944 --> 01:37:31,935
I know I called you a wimp

984
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:33,611
but I take it back!

985
01:37:42,090 --> 01:37:42,955
Hey, No-Face!

986
01:37:43,224 --> 01:37:45,955
You lay one finger on Sen and you'll answer to me!

987
01:37:49,464 --> 01:37:50,454
That's it!

988
01:38:02,243 --> 01:38:03,267
There's the train.

989
01:38:03,544 --> 01:38:04,511
Come on.

990
01:38:28,202 --> 01:38:30,170
We're going to Swamp Bottom.

991
01:38:37,011 --> 01:38:38,308
You coming too?

992
01:38:40,214 --> 01:38:42,114
He's coming too.

993
01:39:22,824 --> 01:39:23,723
Come here.

994
01:39:24,725 --> 01:39:26,215
Be good, okay?

995
01:41:28,549 --> 01:41:29,516
Ojī-san?

996
01:41:32,520 --> 01:41:34,852
Haku, you're awake.

997
01:41:35,089 --> 01:41:36,523
Where has Sen gone?

998
01:41:37,124 --> 01:41:39,525
Please tell me what happened here.

999
01:41:40,094 --> 01:41:42,529
You don't remember?

1000
01:41:43,364 --> 01:41:45,526
Only bits and pieces.

1001
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:48,360
But I could hear Chihiro call my name.

1002
01:41:48,869 --> 01:41:51,566
Her voice carried me back up from the darkness.

1003
01:41:51,772 --> 01:41:52,898
When I awoke, I was here.

1004
01:41:53,374 --> 01:41:55,365
Chihiro?

1005
01:41:55,610 --> 01:41:58,204
So Chihiro was her real name.

1006
01:41:59,547 --> 01:42:02,312
Ah, to be young and in love again...

1007
01:42:06,187 --> 01:42:07,052
How the hell are we supposed to manage repairs

1008
01:42:07,355 --> 01:42:09,050
with this measly pile of gold?

1009
01:42:09,323 --> 01:42:10,051
This is Sen's fault!

1010
01:42:10,257 --> 01:42:11,952
What a total wasted opportunity!

1011
01:42:12,493 --> 01:42:13,221
But ma'am...

1012
01:42:13,527 --> 01:42:15,894
we have Sen to thank for our very lives.

1013
01:42:16,464 --> 01:42:17,522
Silence!

1014
01:42:17,765 --> 01:42:19,961
You have no one but yourselves to blame!

1015
01:42:20,334 --> 01:42:22,564
And now she's run off

1016
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:25,329
even abandoning her own parents!

1017
01:42:26,140 --> 01:42:27,574
Speaking of which, I'm sure they've fattened up nicely.

1018
01:42:27,842 --> 01:42:29,833
I want to see some bacon on my plate tonight.

1019
01:42:30,344 --> 01:42:31,641
A moment, mistress.

1020
01:42:33,047 --> 01:42:34,071
Haku-sama!

1021
01:42:34,348 --> 01:42:36,442
What are you doing still alive?

1022
01:42:39,020 --> 01:42:40,215
You haven't noticed?

1023
01:42:40,454 --> 01:42:42,218
Something dear to you is not as it should be.

1024
01:42:42,823 --> 01:42:45,258
Look who thinks he's big enough to talk back to me.

1025
01:42:45,760 --> 01:42:48,092
Just who died and made you owner of the baths?

1026
01:43:39,814 --> 01:43:41,475
My baby...

1027
01:43:47,855 --> 01:43:49,323
My baby boy!

1028
01:43:49,623 --> 01:43:50,317
It's just dirt.

1029
01:43:50,858 --> 01:43:53,327
My baby!

1030
01:43:54,028 --> 01:43:57,692
Where are you!

1031
01:43:58,365 --> 01:44:00,333
Come out, come out!

1032
01:44:01,602 --> 01:44:02,501
My baby!

1033
01:44:06,207 --> 01:44:08,005
My baby...?

1034
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:16,810
You...!

1035
01:44:18,886 --> 01:44:21,856
Speak!

1036
01:44:23,557 --> 01:44:27,357
What have you done with my child?

1037
01:44:28,262 --> 01:44:29,696
Your sister has him.

1038
01:44:53,120 --> 01:44:56,556
I see... What a nasty woman.

1039
01:44:56,857 --> 01:44:59,383
I bet she thinks she's beaten me.

1040
01:45:01,328 --> 01:45:03,228
So, what are you going to do about this?

1041
01:45:03,998 --> 01:45:05,727
I will bring him back for you.

1042
01:45:06,167 --> 01:45:07,896
However, in exchange you must

1043
01:45:08,202 --> 01:45:10,364
return Sen and her parents to their own world.

1044
01:45:10,638 --> 01:45:12,902
And then what of you?

1045
01:45:13,340 --> 01:45:16,901
Are you prepared to be hung
by the neck from the rafters?

1046
01:46:03,891 --> 01:46:05,825
This is it, right?

1047
01:46:06,827 --> 01:46:07,794
Let's go.

1048
01:46:34,955 --> 01:46:36,286
You can ride on my shoulder.

1049
01:47:55,235 --> 01:47:56,566
Come in.

1050
01:48:01,775 --> 01:48:03,072
Forgive the intrusion.

1051
01:48:05,612 --> 01:48:07,637
Well don't just stand there!

1052
01:48:08,582 --> 01:48:09,413
You too.

1053
01:48:12,920 --> 01:48:14,615
Well done making it this far.

1054
01:48:14,822 --> 01:48:15,482
Um, I...

1055
01:48:15,689 --> 01:48:17,088
Sit, sit.

1056
01:48:17,624 --> 01:48:19,718
I'll put on some tea for you.

1057
01:48:25,733 --> 01:48:28,430
Zenība-san, this is the seal Haku took from you.

1058
01:48:28,702 --> 01:48:29,794
I've come to bring it back.

1059
01:48:32,940 --> 01:48:35,534
Do you even know what this is?

1060
01:48:35,909 --> 01:48:38,606
No, but I know it's important to you.

1061
01:48:38,946 --> 01:48:41,005
I'm here to apologize for Haku.

1062
01:48:41,281 --> 01:48:42,442
We're very sorry.

1063
01:48:43,484 --> 01:48:46,454
You mean you held this and nothing happened to you?

1064
01:48:47,688 --> 01:48:50,385
Hm? The spell I wove into this is gone.

1065
01:48:51,592 --> 01:48:52,423
Ah, sorry.

1066
01:48:52,659 --> 01:48:54,684
There was a weird slug thing attached to it

1067
01:48:54,962 --> 01:48:56,623
but I squished it with my foot.

1068
01:48:57,164 --> 01:49:01,123
You did what?

1069
01:49:01,502 --> 01:49:02,970
My sister put that slug

1070
01:49:03,237 --> 01:49:04,762
inside of the dragon's stomach

1071
01:49:05,005 --> 01:49:07,372
in order to control him!

1072
01:49:07,641 --> 01:49:10,611
And you just... squished it!

1073
01:49:13,080 --> 01:49:14,639
Come now, take a seat.

1074
01:49:14,882 --> 01:49:17,749
You must be No-Face. You join us too.

1075
01:49:18,786 --> 01:49:19,480
Before that...

1076
01:49:19,787 --> 01:49:22,313
Can you turn these two back first?

1077
01:49:22,589 --> 01:49:23,488
Oh? But the curses

1078
01:49:23,757 --> 01:49:25,486
on you little guys wore off a while ago.

1079
01:49:25,759 --> 01:49:27,887
You can change back any time you want.

1080
01:49:35,536 --> 01:49:37,504
You'd think we'd be more alike

1081
01:49:37,771 --> 01:49:39,170
but we've always been at each other's throats.

1082
01:49:39,406 --> 01:49:41,807
She's not exactly low-maintenance, know what I mean?

1083
01:49:42,042 --> 01:49:45,012
Witches should never be born as twins, too much trouble.

1084
01:49:49,316 --> 01:49:51,182
I'd love to help you

1085
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:53,648
but this is out of my hands, I'm afraid.

1086
01:49:53,887 --> 01:49:55,685
There are certain rules in this world we cannot break.

1087
01:49:56,356 --> 01:49:57,346
You'll just have to save them all yourself.

1088
01:49:57,591 --> 01:49:59,081
Both your parents...

1089
01:49:59,359 --> 01:50:01,020
...and your boyfriend, the dragon.

1090
01:50:01,261 --> 01:50:03,855
Can't you give me a hint or something?

1091
01:50:04,565 --> 01:50:06,363
Haku told me that we've met somewhere before

1092
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:08,034
but I just can't remember.

1093
01:50:08,235 --> 01:50:09,862
You should have said so sooner.

1094
01:50:10,437 --> 01:50:12,872
You can never truly forget someone.

1095
01:50:13,140 --> 01:50:15,006
The memory is just evading you.

1096
01:50:16,710 --> 01:50:19,771
Make yourself at home.
You can head back in the morning.

1097
01:50:20,547 --> 01:50:22,777
You three mind giving me a hand?

1098
01:50:29,490 --> 01:50:31,049
Hey now, no slacking.

1099
01:50:34,261 --> 01:50:36,787
You're pretty good at this.

1100
01:50:37,064 --> 01:50:38,395
What a big help you're being.

1101
01:50:39,533 --> 01:50:42,798
Can't just weave it with magic, that would ruin the point.

1102
01:50:44,037 --> 01:50:48,065
Then you pass it through there, good, now twice more.

1103
01:50:48,609 --> 01:50:50,976
Obā-chan, I have to go.

1104
01:50:51,712 --> 01:50:53,202
If I wait here any longer

1105
01:50:53,447 --> 01:50:55,381
Haku might be dead before I get back to him.

1106
01:50:55,582 --> 01:50:56,606
My dad and my mom

1107
01:50:56,817 --> 01:50:58,911
might have already been eaten.

1108
01:51:01,355 --> 01:51:03,585
Something tells me you don't need to worry.

1109
01:51:03,924 --> 01:51:05,551
Here, it's done.

1110
01:51:06,426 --> 01:51:08,224
A hair tie, just for you.

1111
01:51:13,633 --> 01:51:14,428
It's beautiful.

1112
01:51:14,835 --> 01:51:17,980
We made this together for you.

1113
01:51:17,938 --> 01:51:19,565
It will always keep you safe.

1114
01:51:20,007 --> 01:51:21,236
Thank you.

1115
01:51:30,817 --> 01:51:32,114
About time he showed up.

1116
01:51:32,386 --> 01:51:34,411
We have a guest. Why don't you let him in?

1117
01:51:34,655 --> 01:51:35,622
Okay.

1118
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:54,805
You're alive.

1119
01:51:55,409 --> 01:51:57,605
Are you okay? Are you still hurt?

1120
01:51:58,078 --> 01:51:59,011
I'm so happy.

1121
01:52:01,129 --> 01:52:02,806
What good timing.

1122
01:52:03,951 --> 01:52:05,976
Obā-chan, he's okay!

1123
01:52:06,954 --> 01:52:07,819
Dragon Haku.

1124
01:52:08,055 --> 01:52:10,820
I absolve you of your crime to me.

1125
01:52:11,191 --> 01:52:14,320
But in exchange, you must protect this little one.

1126
01:52:14,761 --> 01:52:17,662
Time for my sweet nephew to head home too.

1127
01:52:17,931 --> 01:52:19,160
Come visit me whenever you want.

1128
01:52:20,734 --> 01:52:22,498
You can stay here with me.

1129
01:52:22,736 --> 01:52:24,500
I could use a pair of hands around the house.

1130
01:52:29,176 --> 01:52:31,144
We have to go now. Thanks for everything.

1131
01:52:31,378 --> 01:52:34,177
You can do it, I know you can.

1132
01:52:34,648 --> 01:52:37,674
My real name is Chihiro.

1133
01:52:38,018 --> 01:52:40,350
Chihiro, what a pretty name.

1134
01:52:40,587 --> 01:52:42,282
Respect your name and keep it safe.

1135
01:52:42,489 --> 01:52:43,149
I will.

1136
01:52:43,390 --> 01:52:44,152
Now go.

1137
01:52:47,027 --> 01:52:49,689
Obā-chan, thank you! I'll miss you!

1138
01:53:39,079 --> 01:53:40,478
Haku, listen.

1139
01:53:40,847 --> 01:53:42,144
I don't really remember it myself

1140
01:53:42,416 --> 01:53:44,407
but my mom told me a story once of when I was little.

1141
01:53:44,918 --> 01:53:48,252
She said I fell into a river one day.

1142
01:53:49,056 --> 01:53:50,581
The river's not there anymore, though.

1143
01:53:50,891 --> 01:53:52,757
They paved over it and put up apartments.

1144
01:53:53,060 --> 01:53:54,926
But it just came back to me.

1145
01:53:56,263 --> 01:53:57,890
The name of the river.

1146
01:53:58,532 --> 01:54:01,263
It's name was the Kohaku River.

1147
01:54:02,102 --> 01:54:03,763
I think your real name is

1148
01:54:04,004 --> 01:54:05,335
the Kohaku River.

1149
01:54:26,660 --> 01:54:29,425
Chihiro, you've done it! My true name is

1150
01:54:29,663 --> 01:54:31,427
Nigi-haya-mi Ko-haku-nushi!

1151
01:54:31,932 --> 01:54:32,797
Nigi-haya-mi?

1152
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:35,125
Nigi-haya-mi Ko-haku-nushi.

1153
01:54:35,369 --> 01:54:37,804
It's like a god's name, that's amazing.

1154
01:54:38,338 --> 01:54:39,806
I remember everything now.

1155
01:54:40,040 --> 01:54:42,532
I remember the day you fell into me

1156
01:54:42,976 --> 01:54:44,375
trying to fish out the shoe you dropped!

1157
01:54:44,811 --> 01:54:48,805
And you carried me back to the river bank.

1158
01:54:50,150 --> 01:54:51,049
I'm so happy.

1159
01:55:24,151 --> 01:55:25,516
There they are!

1160
01:55:38,899 --> 01:55:41,266
You better have brought back my baby boy!

1161
01:55:44,304 --> 01:55:45,032
Mommy!

1162
01:55:45,338 --> 01:55:47,534
My boy! Are you hurt?

1163
01:55:47,774 --> 01:55:49,674
They put you through so much.

1164
01:55:50,744 --> 01:55:53,213
You're standing up on your own. How?

1165
01:55:54,781 --> 01:55:56,681
Yubāba-sama! It's time!

1166
01:55:56,950 --> 01:55:59,851
Send Chihiro and her parents back to their world!

1167
01:56:00,353 --> 01:56:02,720
It isn't as simple as that, and you know it!

1168
01:56:02,956 --> 01:56:05,118
We have rules here and we're going to follow them!

1169
01:56:06,760 --> 01:56:07,727
Shut it!

1170
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:09,759
Come on Mom, cut it out.

1171
01:56:10,964 --> 01:56:13,126
I had a great time.

1172
01:56:13,934 --> 01:56:16,562
But sweetie, the rules are the rules...

1173
01:56:16,837 --> 01:56:19,101
Otherwise we can't lift the curse.

1174
01:56:19,439 --> 01:56:20,304
If you make Sen cry

1175
01:56:20,574 --> 01:56:22,508
I'm gonna hate you forever.

1176
01:56:22,943 --> 01:56:24,035
But I...

1177
01:56:24,277 --> 01:56:25,540
Obā-chan!

1178
01:56:25,779 --> 01:56:26,905
Who, me?

1179
01:56:27,481 --> 01:56:29,074
I'll do it.

1180
01:56:40,594 --> 01:56:43,029
Haku has told me about the rules.

1181
01:56:43,230 --> 01:56:44,925
Then let's get this over with.

1182
01:56:45,165 --> 01:56:48,260
This is your contract. Come with me.

1183
01:56:48,568 --> 01:56:50,593
We'll be done right away, sweetie.

1184
01:56:51,705 --> 01:56:52,763
I'll be fine.

1185
01:56:57,511 --> 01:56:58,808
See these pigs?

1186
01:56:59,012 --> 01:57:01,174
Point at the ones you think are your parents.

1187
01:57:10,757 --> 01:57:12,122
You get one chance.

1188
01:57:12,359 --> 01:57:14,885
Guess right and you're free to go.

1189
01:57:25,205 --> 01:57:27,799
Something's wrong.

1190
01:57:28,074 --> 01:57:30,406
None of these pigs are my parents.

1191
01:57:30,710 --> 01:57:34,146
You sure? Is that your final answer?

1192
01:57:39,753 --> 01:57:42,654
Bingo!

1193
01:57:49,496 --> 01:57:50,554
Thank you, everyone!

1194
01:57:50,830 --> 01:57:52,320
Alright, you win.

1195
01:57:52,566 --> 01:57:54,000
Just hurry up and go.

1196
01:57:54,534 --> 01:57:55,626
Thank you for the job.

1197
01:57:57,037 --> 01:57:58,163
Goodbye!

1198
01:57:59,172 --> 01:57:59,900
Thanks!

1199
01:58:00,173 --> 01:58:01,334
See you soon!

1200
01:58:02,609 --> 01:58:03,474
This way!

1201
01:58:04,110 --> 01:58:05,407
Where are my parents?

1202
01:58:05,612 --> 01:58:06,773
They're up ahead.

1203
01:58:14,421 --> 01:58:15,479
The water is gone...

1204
01:58:15,722 --> 01:58:17,190
This is as far as I go.

1205
01:58:17,802 --> 01:58:19,962
Follow the path back the way you came.

1206
01:58:20,293 --> 01:58:21,917
But whatever you do, don't turn back.

1207
01:58:22,317 --> 01:58:23,491
You'll be safe once you're through the tunnel.

1208
01:58:23,663 --> 01:58:25,427
But what about you?

1209
01:58:26,166 --> 01:58:28,692
I'm going to talk to Yubāba
and take back from freedom.

1210
01:58:29,002 --> 01:58:31,369
You've given me my name back,
there's nothing she can do.

1211
01:58:32,172 --> 01:58:33,867
I will leave this world and return home as well.

1212
01:58:34,107 --> 01:58:35,199
Will we ever see each other again?

1213
01:58:35,475 --> 01:58:36,203
We will.

1214
01:58:36,409 --> 01:58:37,069
Promise me.

1215
01:58:37,277 --> 01:58:40,372
We will. Now go, and don't look back.

1216
01:59:05,472 --> 01:59:07,941
Hurry up, we have to get going!

1217
01:59:11,578 --> 01:59:13,239
Mom! Dad!

1218
01:59:13,513 --> 01:59:15,072
Where were you? We were worried.

1219
01:59:15,348 --> 01:59:16,247
Let's go.

1220
01:59:17,117 --> 01:59:19,085
Mom, are you okay?

1221
01:59:20,286 --> 01:59:21,310
The moving van

1222
01:59:21,588 --> 01:59:23,317
has definitely reached the house by now.

1223
01:59:33,099 --> 01:59:34,931
Chihiro, let's go!

1224
01:59:44,110 --> 01:59:45,600
Watch your step.

1225
01:59:45,879 --> 01:59:47,608
Chihiro, stop tugging my arm,

1226
01:59:47,881 --> 01:59:48,939
I can't walk straight.

1227
02:00:01,494 --> 02:00:02,586
We're out.

1228
02:00:03,229 --> 02:00:04,355
What the...?

1229
02:00:04,931 --> 02:00:05,955
What's wrong?

1230
02:00:06,833 --> 02:00:08,028
Look at this.

1231
02:00:10,070 --> 02:00:12,129
The car's filled with dust.

1232
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:13,366
Some kind of prank?

1233
02:00:13,640 --> 02:00:14,471
Yeah, maybe.

1234
02:00:14,708 --> 02:00:16,870
We never should have gone in there.

1235
02:00:22,882 --> 02:00:24,976
The car starts, I guess it's fine.

1236
02:00:26,619 --> 02:00:28,314
Chihiro, we're leaving!

1237
02:00:28,888 --> 02:00:31,482
Chihiro, get in the car!
