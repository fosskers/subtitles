3
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:15,175
Good Luck, Chihiro
We'll meet again

4
00:00:15,282 --> 00:00:16,716
Chihiro

5
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,045
Chihiro,

6
00:00:18,285 --> 00:00:19,719
we're almost there

7
00:00:22,689 --> 00:00:24,680
This really is the
middle of nowhere

8
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:27,624
I'll have to shop
in the next town

9
00:00:27,728 --> 00:00:29,787
It'll be great, once
we get used to it

10
00:00:32,199 --> 00:00:34,224
Look, there's the school

11
00:00:34,334 --> 00:00:36,098
That's your new school. Chihiro

12
00:00:37,037 --> 00:00:39,233
It doesn't look so bad

13
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:49,074
I liked my old school...

14
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:56,119
Mommy...
My flowers died

15
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:58,882
No wonder, the way
you clung to them

16
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,927
A little water when we get there
and they'll perk right up

17
00:01:02,996 --> 00:01:06,591
My very first bouquet is
farewell flowers, how sad

18
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:10,136
What about that rose
you got for your birthday?

19
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:13,332
One rose isn't a bouquet

20
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:15,101
You dropped your card

21
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:16,642
I'm opening the window

22
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,576
C'mon now, behave yourself
It's a big day for all of us

23
00:01:38,832 --> 00:01:44,271
SPIRITED AWAY

24
00:01:56,383 --> 00:02:00,320
Hey...
Did I take the wrong turn?

25
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:02,277
I don't get it

26
00:02:02,389 --> 00:02:04,483
That must be it, look

27
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:07,355
It must be that
blue one over there

28
00:02:07,794 --> 00:02:09,125
That's it

29
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:12,222
I must've missed the turn-off

30
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,400
I bet this road'll get us there

31
00:02:14,501 --> 00:02:17,027
This is always how
you get us lost

32
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:19,128
Just a little farther, OK?

33
00:02:19,573 --> 00:02:21,337
What are those little houses?

34
00:02:21,441 --> 00:02:23,170
They're shrines
People pray to them

35
00:02:30,083 --> 00:02:31,676
Daddy, are we lost?

36
00:02:31,785 --> 00:02:34,379
We're fine, we've
got 4-wheel drive

37
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:36,320
Sit down, Chihiro

38
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:58,774
You're going to kill us!

39
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:01,644
A tunnel?

40
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,857
What's this strange building?

41
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:19,796
Must be the way in

42
00:03:20,701 --> 00:03:21,429
Honey...

43
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:23,727
Let's go back, honey

44
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,803
Chihiro

45
00:03:27,374 --> 00:03:28,273
No...

46
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:31,041
It's just plaster

47
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,235
This building's pretty new

48
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:44,755
The wind's going in

49
00:03:45,392 --> 00:03:46,382
What is it?

50
00:03:46,493 --> 00:03:48,757
Let's have a look
There's a way through

51
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:51,490
It's creepy, Daddy. let's go back

52
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:54,296
No need to be scared

53
00:03:54,401 --> 00:03:56,165
Just a little farther, OK?

54
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,260
The moving van'll
get there before us

55
00:03:58,405 --> 00:04:02,501
So, let 'em, they've got the keys
Let the movers move us

56
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,633
I know, but...

57
00:04:03,744 --> 00:04:05,678
No! I won't go!

58
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:09,808
Daddy. let's go back

59
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,314
Nothing to be scared of

60
00:04:11,518 --> 00:04:13,179
I won't go!

61
00:04:21,428 --> 00:04:23,920
Chihiro, you wait in the car

62
00:04:25,866 --> 00:04:27,766
Mommy

63
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:31,034
Wait

64
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:38,271
Watch your step

65
00:04:38,378 --> 00:04:41,643
You'll make me trip, Chihiro,
clinging like that

66
00:05:13,580 --> 00:05:14,741
Where are we?

67
00:05:14,848 --> 00:05:17,044
Say, do you hear that?

68
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:26,816
It's a train!

69
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:28,759
Maybe we're near the station

70
00:05:28,862 --> 00:05:30,728
Let's go and find out

71
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:09,696
What are those houses doing here?

72
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:11,396
I knew it

73
00:06:11,805 --> 00:06:14,570
This must be an abandoned
theme park

74
00:06:16,376 --> 00:06:19,812
They built so many
in the early '90s,

75
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:22,405
but they all went down
with the economy

76
00:06:22,782 --> 00:06:25,114
This must be one of 'em

77
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,209
What! Even farther!

78
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,914
Let's go back, Daddy

79
00:06:32,893 --> 00:06:34,554
C'mon!

80
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:47,070
Mommy, that building's moaning

81
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,398
It's just the wind

82
00:06:48,909 --> 00:06:50,741
What a lovely spot

83
00:06:50,844 --> 00:06:53,370
We should've brought
our lunch with us

84
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:58,282
They were making a river

85
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:05,418
Hey, you smell that?

86
00:07:06,192 --> 00:07:08,183
See, it smells great

87
00:07:08,295 --> 00:07:09,387
You're right

88
00:07:09,496 --> 00:07:12,261
Maybe they're still open

89
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:14,124
Hurry up, Chihiro

90
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,361
Wait for me!

91
00:07:49,469 --> 00:07:50,800
This way

92
00:07:54,975 --> 00:07:58,411
Can you believe it,
they're all restaurants

93
00:07:58,511 --> 00:08:00,605
Where is everybody?

94
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:04,647
Over there!

95
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,984
Hey. hey!

96
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,695
In here, here

97
00:08:26,339 --> 00:08:28,501
How amazing

98
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:31,543
Hello, anybody here?

99
00:08:31,644 --> 00:08:34,079
Come in, Chihiro,
it looks delicious

100
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:35,505
Hello!

101
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:44,013
Oh, don't worry
We can pay them when they get back

102
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,684
You're right
That one looks great...

103
00:08:46,793 --> 00:08:48,887
I wonder what this is called

104
00:08:50,630 --> 00:08:53,531
Delicious! Chihiro, taste it

105
00:08:54,034 --> 00:08:55,297
I don't want to!

106
00:08:55,402 --> 00:08:58,133
Let's go!
They're gonna be mad at us

107
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:01,634
Don't worry,
you've got Daddy here

108
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:03,835
I've got credit cards and cash

109
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:10,543
Take some, Chihiro,
It's so tender

110
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,308
Mustard

111
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,251
Thank you

112
00:09:24,998 --> 00:09:27,660
Mommy !
Daddy!

113
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:38,495
Weird...

114
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,094
There's a train!

115
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,546
You're not allowed here
Go back!

116
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:23,509
Wha...?

117
00:11:23,616 --> 00:11:26,551
It's almost night!
Leave before it gets dark

118
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:31,383
They're lighting the lamps
Go!

119
00:11:31,491 --> 00:11:34,051
I'll distract them
Get back across the river!

120
00:11:48,308 --> 00:11:50,402
What's his problem?

121
00:11:58,885 --> 00:12:00,080
Daddy!

122
00:12:01,154 --> 00:12:02,815
Daddy. let's go home

123
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,617
Let's go. Daddy!

124
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,443
Daddy!
Mommy !

125
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:45,921
Mommy !

126
00:13:07,787 --> 00:13:09,277
It's water!

127
00:13:22,402 --> 00:13:23,699
This can't be...

128
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,567
I'm dreaming, dreaming!

129
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,372
Wake up! Wake up!

130
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,442
Wake... up...

131
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:41,186
It's just a dream, a dream

132
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:44,280
Go away. disappear

133
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,091
Disappear

134
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,590
I can see through!

135
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:00,836
It's a dream, it's got to be

136
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:55,919
Don't be afraid, I'm a friend

137
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,090
No, no, no!

138
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:00,191
Open your mouth and eat this

139
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,365
Unless you eat something
from this world, you'll vanish

140
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:04,630
No!

141
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:12,006
Don't worry
It won't turn you into a pig

142
00:15:12,111 --> 00:15:13,806
Chew it and swallow

143
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,947
Good girl, you're fine

144
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:27,651
See for yourself

145
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,129
I'm back again...

146
00:15:37,236 --> 00:15:39,500
You see?
Now come

147
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:43,633
What about my mom and dad? They
didn't really turn into pigs, did they?

148
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,408
You can't see them now,
but you will

149
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:50,678
Quiet!

150
00:16:08,835 --> 00:16:10,269
It's looking for you

151
00:16:10,369 --> 00:16:12,064
There's no time, let's run!

152
00:16:13,272 --> 00:16:15,866
I... I can't stand! Oh, no!

153
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:17,299
My legs don't work

154
00:16:17,410 --> 00:16:19,902
Calm, now
Take a deep breath

155
00:16:23,549 --> 00:16:27,747
In the name of the wind and
the water within thee... Unbind her

156
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,010
Get up!

157
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,299
Hold your breath while
we're on the bridge

158
00:17:15,568 --> 00:17:17,730
Even a tiny breath,

159
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:20,670
will break the spell and
the attendants will see you

160
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:27,407
I'm scared

161
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:29,003
Be calm

162
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:32,240
Welcome
Always nice to see you

163
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,513
Welcome, welcome

164
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,148
I'm back from my task

165
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,019
Welcome back, sir

166
00:17:39,258 --> 00:17:41,022
A deep breath...

167
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:43,286
And hold...

168
00:18:00,279 --> 00:18:03,943
Welcome back!
We missed you!

169
00:18:05,217 --> 00:18:07,015
Hang on, we're almost...

170
00:18:07,954 --> 00:18:09,513
Master Haku!

171
00:18:10,289 --> 00:18:11,882
Where have you...

172
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,087
Wha...
A human?

173
00:18:16,062 --> 00:18:17,223
Run!

174
00:18:19,298 --> 00:18:20,891
What...

175
00:18:33,813 --> 00:18:36,145
Master Haku, Master Haku!

176
00:18:36,248 --> 00:18:38,910
Chase after it
A human intruder!

177
00:18:39,018 --> 00:18:41,282
I smell humans!
The stench of humans!

178
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:42,218
They know you're here

179
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,153
I'm sorry. I took a breath

180
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:46,315
No. Chihiro, you did very well

181
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,253
Listen and I'll
tell you what to do

182
00:18:49,362 --> 00:18:50,796
Stay here, and they'll find you

183
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:54,831
I'll distract them
In the meantime, you escape

184
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:57,335
No, don't go!
Stay with me, please

185
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,029
You have no choice,
if you want to survive here

186
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,801
And save your parents, too

187
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:06,571
So they did turn into pigs...
I wasn't dreaming...

188
00:19:06,679 --> 00:19:08,113
Be still...

189
00:19:09,181 --> 00:19:12,515
When things quiet down,
go out by the back gate

190
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,485
Take the stairs, all the way down

191
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,285
Until you reach the boiler room,
where they stoke the fires

192
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,917
Kamaji's there, so look for him

193
00:19:23,462 --> 00:19:24,293
Kamaji?

194
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,023
Ask him for work

195
00:19:28,134 --> 00:19:29,568
Even if he rejects you, persist

196
00:19:30,269 --> 00:19:33,534
If you don't work, Yubaba will
turn you into an animal

197
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:35,269
Yubaba?

198
00:19:35,374 --> 00:19:38,071
You'll see
She's the sorceress who rules our world

199
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:41,675
Kamaji will turn you away,
trick you into you leaving,

200
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:43,306
but keep on asking him for work

201
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:46,118
It'll be hard work,
but it will give you a chance

202
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:48,312
Then even Yubaba can't harm you

203
00:19:48,421 --> 00:19:49,320
OK

204
00:19:49,689 --> 00:19:52,317
Master Haku, Master Haku!

205
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,819
I have to go

206
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:56,520
Remember, Chihiro
I'm your friend

207
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:58,063
How do you know my name?

208
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:00,598
I've known you
since you were small

209
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:02,868
My name is Haku

210
00:20:05,738 --> 00:20:07,604
Here I am!

211
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,840
Master Haku, Yubaba wants you

212
00:20:11,944 --> 00:20:14,936
I know
It's about my task

213
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,961
Um...

214
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:27,162
Excuse me

215
00:24:34,006 --> 00:24:35,337
Um...

216
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:44,413
Um, are you Kamaji?

217
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:55,855
Um, Haku sent me here
Please let me work here

218
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:03,735
Darn, all at once...

219
00:25:04,370 --> 00:25:06,600
Get to work, you little runts

220
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:10,369
I'm... Kamaji

221
00:25:10,476 --> 00:25:13,241
Slave to the boilers
that heat the baths

222
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,370
Step on it, boys!

223
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:18,607
Um, please let me work here!

224
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:23,052
I've got all the help I need
The place is full of soot

225
00:25:23,155 --> 00:25:26,022
Plenty of replacements

226
00:25:40,572 --> 00:25:42,506
Oh, I'm sorry

227
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:48,272
Please wait

228
00:26:00,092 --> 00:26:01,582
Outta the way!

229
00:26:54,646 --> 00:26:56,910
Um...
What should I do with this?

230
00:27:03,655 --> 00:27:05,248
Do I just leave it?

231
00:27:05,657 --> 00:27:07,751
Finish what you start!

232
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:44,351
It's hot

233
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:11,387
Hey, you runts!
Wanna turn back into soot?

234
00:28:11,490 --> 00:28:15,188
And you, watch it
You can't just take someone's job

235
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:18,730
If they don't work,
the spell wears off

236
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:21,925
Got no work for you here
Look elsewhere

237
00:28:31,009 --> 00:28:33,671
You sootballs got a problem?!

238
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,178
Get to work! To work!

239
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,808
Chow time

240
00:28:38,083 --> 00:28:40,518
What? You guys at it again?

241
00:28:42,421 --> 00:28:45,356
Cut it out
Where's your bowl?

242
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:48,316
I keep telling you
to leave it out

243
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,086
Meal time!
Take a break!

244
00:29:06,712 --> 00:29:08,874
A human! You're in trouble!

245
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:11,177
They're having a fit
about it upstairs

246
00:29:12,384 --> 00:29:14,216
That's my granddaughter

247
00:29:14,319 --> 00:29:15,753
Granddaughter !?

248
00:29:16,622 --> 00:29:20,388
Says she wants to work,
but I've got all the help I need

249
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:24,019
Would you take her to Yubaba?

250
00:29:24,129 --> 00:29:25,893
The girl can handle her, I'm sure

251
00:29:25,998 --> 00:29:28,490
Not a chance!
And risk my life!?

252
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,695
Take this, then
A roasted newt

253
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,396
Real quality

254
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:39,511
If you want to work, you'll have
to make a deal with Yubaba

255
00:29:39,611 --> 00:29:41,807
Might as well try your luck

256
00:29:42,981 --> 00:29:45,814
Fine!
You there, follow me

257
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:54,683
Can't you even manage a
“Yes ma'am,” or “Thank you"?

258
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:56,192
Yes... yes ma'am

259
00:29:56,295 --> 00:29:57,888
You sure are slow
Hurry!

260
00:29:57,996 --> 00:29:58,986
Yes ma'am

261
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,470
What do vou need shoes for!
Or socks!

262
00:30:04,569 --> 00:30:05,730
Yes ma'am!

263
00:30:11,109 --> 00:30:13,271
Did you even thank Kamaji?

264
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,142
He's looking out for you

265
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,283
Thank you very much, sir

266
00:30:20,786 --> 00:30:22,117
Good luck

267
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,722
Yubaba lives way up at the top,
in the back

268
00:30:49,247 --> 00:30:51,579
Get over here!

269
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,447
You wanna lose your nose?

270
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,770
We're almost there

271
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:24,974
Right

272
00:31:29,454 --> 00:31:30,546
Here we are

273
00:31:33,959 --> 00:31:35,290
Wel... welcome!

274
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:45,702
This elevator is not in service, sir
Please use another

275
00:32:08,427 --> 00:32:09,360
He's following us...

276
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:10,860
Quit gawking

277
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,545
Here we are

278
00:32:33,218 --> 00:32:35,744
Your room is on the right

279
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,354
Lin?

280
00:32:39,458 --> 00:32:40,789
Yes!

281
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,124
What's that smell?

282
00:32:44,729 --> 00:32:46,993
It's human
You reek of human

283
00:32:47,098 --> 00:32:47,963
Is that so?

284
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,897
I smell it, I do
Smells mighty tasty, too

285
00:32:52,471 --> 00:32:54,906
You're hiding something

286
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,406
Tell me the truth, now

287
00:32:57,509 --> 00:32:58,704
This smell?

288
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:01,474
Roasted...
Gimme!

289
00:33:01,713 --> 00:33:04,876
Not a chance
It's for the other girls

290
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:08,142
I'm begging you
I'll settle for a leg!

291
00:33:09,221 --> 00:33:12,088
Anyone going up,
pull down on the lever

292
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,462
Not going to knock?!

293
00:35:00,332 --> 00:35:03,233
What a puny little girl

294
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:15,512
Come closer...

295
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:20,884
I said closer

296
00:35:35,467 --> 00:35:37,629
Ouch...

297
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:50,812
You're making a racket
Keep it down

298
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:10,959
Um...

299
00:36:11,403 --> 00:36:13,462
Please let me work here

300
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:25,114
Stop babbling

301
00:36:25,216 --> 00:36:28,447
You're just a useless weakling

302
00:36:28,753 --> 00:36:32,986
Besides, this is
no place for humans

303
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,524
It's a bath house,

304
00:36:36,628 --> 00:36:40,462
where 8 million gods can
rest their weary bones

305
00:36:41,366 --> 00:36:44,597
Your parents had some nerve!

306
00:36:44,703 --> 00:36:48,333
Gobbling our guests'
food like pigs!

307
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:50,534
Just desserts. I'd say

308
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:54,044
And you'll never see...

309
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:56,374
your world again either

310
00:37:00,118 --> 00:37:02,951
You'd make a lovely piglet

311
00:37:03,388 --> 00:37:06,085
Or maybe a lump of coal

312
00:37:13,965 --> 00:37:15,558
I see you're trembling

313
00:37:15,667 --> 00:37:19,399
Actually, I'm impressed
you made it this far

314
00:37:19,504 --> 00:37:22,633
Someone must've helped you

315
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:25,065
I must thank your friend

316
00:37:25,176 --> 00:37:29,704
Just who was it, my dear?
You can tell me

317
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,307
Please let me work here!

318
00:37:34,486 --> 00:37:35,976
Not that again!

319
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:37,521
I want to work here!

320
00:37:37,889 --> 00:37:42,827
Shut Up!

321
00:37:46,431 --> 00:37:50,265
Why should I hire you?

322
00:37:50,368 --> 00:37:54,703
Anyone can see you're
a lazy, spoiled, crybaby

323
00:37:54,806 --> 00:37:57,241
Stupid to boot

324
00:37:57,342 --> 00:37:59,834
I've nothing for you

325
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:01,935
Forget it

326
00:38:02,046 --> 00:38:05,744
I've got all the bums
I need around here

327
00:38:06,751 --> 00:38:11,018
Or maybe you'd like the worst,

328
00:38:11,122 --> 00:38:13,181
nastiest job I've got,

329
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:18,229
until you breathe
your very last breath?!

330
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,970
Stop that!
What's wrong...

331
00:38:34,879 --> 00:38:37,541
I'll be right there
That's a good baby, now

332
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:40,474
What? You still here!
Get out!

333
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:42,514
I want to work here!

334
00:38:42,887 --> 00:38:46,323
Don't shout

335
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:50,088
I'll be right there...

336
00:38:50,995 --> 00:38:53,521
That's a good baby,
there, there

337
00:38:53,898 --> 00:38:55,923
Please let me work!

338
00:38:56,067 --> 00:38:58,900
OK. OK. just pipe down

339
00:38:59,237 --> 00:39:03,765
There. there, now

340
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:25,626
Your contract

341
00:39:26,598 --> 00:39:28,623
Sign your name

342
00:39:29,267 --> 00:39:30,757
I'll put you to work

343
00:39:31,436 --> 00:39:34,371
But one peep out of you
about anything,

344
00:39:34,472 --> 00:39:36,873
and I'll turn you
right into a piglet!

345
00:39:37,709 --> 00:39:39,871
Um, I sign my name here?

346
00:39:39,978 --> 00:39:43,312
That's right
Quit dilly-dallying and do it

347
00:39:47,952 --> 00:39:50,114
Unbelievable

348
00:39:50,622 --> 00:39:53,455
That ridiculous oath I took

349
00:39:54,959 --> 00:39:58,452
To give work to whoever asks

350
00:40:00,798 --> 00:40:01,458
Signed it?

351
00:40:01,566 --> 00:40:02,556
Yes

352
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:08,937
You're Chihiro, huh?

353
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:09,632
Yes

354
00:40:09,974 --> 00:40:12,636
What an extravagant name

355
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,817
From now on, you'll be Sen

356
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:27,155
You got that? You're Sen

357
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:29,852
Answer me, Sen!

358
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,424
Yes...

359
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:33,030
Did you call?

360
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:39,334
This child's starting work as of now
Look after her

361
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,199
Yes

362
00:40:41,005 --> 00:40:42,063
Your name?

363
00:40:42,173 --> 00:40:43,072
What?

364
00:40:43,174 --> 00:40:45,836
Chi... Oh, I'm Sen

365
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:48,339
Follow me, then. Sen

366
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:58,117
Haku... Um...

367
00:40:58,523 --> 00:41:00,184
No idle chatter

368
00:41:00,291 --> 00:41:02,623
Call me Master Haku

369
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,677
Even on Yubaba's orders...

370
00:41:21,779 --> 00:41:23,269
We can't allow humans

371
00:41:23,881 --> 00:41:25,371
Her contract's signed

372
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:26,143
What...?

373
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:27,649
Thank you, everyone

374
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:31,422
Don't send her to us
Can't bear that human stink

375
00:41:32,223 --> 00:41:35,158
Three days of eating our food
and her smell will vanish

376
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:39,355
If she's still useless then, fry her,
boil her, do with her as you will

377
00:41:41,232 --> 00:41:43,428
Back to work!
Where's Lin?

378
00:41:43,735 --> 00:41:45,931
Don't dump her on me!

379
00:41:46,504 --> 00:41:47,869
You wanted help

380
00:41:47,972 --> 00:41:50,805
That's right, Lin's just perfect

381
00:41:51,242 --> 00:41:52,334
Go, Sen

382
00:41:52,443 --> 00:41:53,433
Yes sir

383
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:57,510
What a pain
You're gonna pay for this

384
00:41:58,082 --> 00:41:59,641
Off you go!

385
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,349
C'mon

386
00:42:12,196 --> 00:42:13,664
So you pulled it off, huh?!

387
00:42:14,332 --> 00:42:16,426
You're so thick,
I was worried

388
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:20,532
Keep your wits, now
If you need something, ask me, OK?

389
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:23,930
What's wrong

390
00:42:24,942 --> 00:42:26,933
I'm dizzy

391
00:42:31,449 --> 00:42:33,543
So this is our room

392
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:36,951
Chow, then bed,
you'll be fine

393
00:42:39,957 --> 00:42:43,120
You wash your own apron!
Trousers!

394
00:42:43,895 --> 00:42:46,057
You're so puny

395
00:42:46,731 --> 00:42:48,221
Too big...

396
00:42:50,301 --> 00:42:51,894
Um, Lin...

397
00:42:52,003 --> 00:42:52,993
What?

398
00:42:53,104 --> 00:42:55,129
Are there two Hakus here?

399
00:42:55,473 --> 00:42:56,634
Two?!

400
00:42:56,741 --> 00:42:59,233
Of him? I sure hope not

401
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:00,467
Still too big

402
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:03,309
He's Yubaba's henchman
Watch out for him

403
00:43:06,751 --> 00:43:08,913
Where the...

404
00:43:09,654 --> 00:43:11,816
Here they are

405
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:17,253
What's wrong?
Are you 0K?

406
00:43:18,162 --> 00:43:20,597
What's all the fuss, Lin?

407
00:43:20,698 --> 00:43:23,030
New girl
Says she feels faint

408
00:44:55,026 --> 00:44:59,293
Meet me at the bridge
I'll show you your mother and father

409
00:45:43,641 --> 00:45:44,631
My shoes...

410
00:45:58,990 --> 00:46:00,583
Thank you

411
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,494
Follow me

412
00:47:53,537 --> 00:47:56,131
Daddy. Mommy, it's me!

413
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:57,935
It's Sen

414
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:01,038
Mommy, Daddy!

415
00:48:04,281 --> 00:48:06,147
Are they sick or hurt?

416
00:48:06,250 --> 00:48:08,947
No, they ate too much
Sleeping it of f

417
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,655
They don't even remember
being human

418
00:48:18,295 --> 00:48:20,889
Daddy, Mommy,
I promise I'll save you!

419
00:48:20,998 --> 00:48:23,990
Don't get too fat,
or they'll eat you!

420
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,141
Hide these

421
00:48:36,814 --> 00:48:38,077
I thought they were gone

422
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:40,481
You'll need them
when you to get home

423
00:48:46,590 --> 00:48:48,922
This was a farewell card...

424
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:51,795
Chi-hi-ro

425
00:48:52,263 --> 00:48:55,358
Chihiro...
That's my name

426
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,832
Yubaba rules others by
stealing their names

427
00:48:59,603 --> 00:49:03,699
You're Sen here, but keep your
real name a secret

428
00:49:04,008 --> 00:49:07,069
She almost got mine
I'd nearly turned into Sen

429
00:49:08,012 --> 00:49:11,209
If she steals your name, you'll
never find your way home

430
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:14,584
I no longer remember mine

431
00:49:14,852 --> 00:49:16,581
Your real name?

432
00:49:16,854 --> 00:49:20,188
But it's strange
I remembered yours

433
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,220
Go ahead, eat,
you must be hungry

434
00:49:25,496 --> 00:49:26,895
I don't want to

435
00:49:27,198 --> 00:49:31,226
I put a spell on it to give you
back your strength, eat it

436
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,330
You've had a hard time
Eat some more

437
00:50:25,256 --> 00:50:26,655
Can you find your way back?

438
00:50:26,757 --> 00:50:29,351
Yes, Haku, thank you
I'll work very hard

439
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:30,621
Good

440
00:52:04,288 --> 00:52:06,780
Where were you?
I was worried

441
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,051
I'm sorry

442
00:52:17,401 --> 00:52:19,165
Outta my way

443
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:34,311
That the best you can do?

444
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,378
You and Sen get
the big tub as of today

445
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:39,712
What! But that's Frog work!

446
00:52:39,823 --> 00:52:42,815
Orders from the top
Better give it your all

447
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,879
Aren't you... getting wet?

448
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:10,679
Hurry up, Sen!

449
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,119
Coming!

450
00:53:12,222 --> 00:53:13,951
I'll leave this open

451
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:42,977
On the big tub, Lin?

452
00:53:43,087 --> 00:53:43,781
Lay off me

453
00:53:47,491 --> 00:53:50,654
Jerks!
They haven't scrubbed this in ages!

454
00:54:05,175 --> 00:54:08,338
This bath is reserved
for our filthiest guests

455
00:54:08,512 --> 00:54:10,105
It's caked with sludge

456
00:54:10,481 --> 00:54:12,882
Lin, Sen, first customers are here

457
00:54:13,150 --> 00:54:14,811
Right away...

458
00:54:14,918 --> 00:54:17,080
Shoot, clearly harassment

459
00:54:17,187 --> 00:54:20,316
This tub needs an herbal soak
Get a tag from the foreman

460
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,448
A tag?

461
00:54:24,328 --> 00:54:26,194
An herbal soak tag

462
00:54:26,430 --> 00:54:27,693
Right

463
00:54:28,832 --> 00:54:30,493
What's a foreman, Lin?

464
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:37,504
Something's coming
I wonder what

465
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:50,351
Some useless scum,
under cover of rainfall...

466
00:55:14,578 --> 00:55:17,104
I can't waste that on you!

467
00:55:17,347 --> 00:55:19,008
Why good morning!

468
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:21,417
Feeling refreshed?

469
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,046
For Kasuga sama

470
00:55:23,153 --> 00:55:25,315
One deluxe sulfur soak

471
00:55:25,556 --> 00:55:28,116
No point in standing there
Back to work!

472
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,152
Scrub with your hands

473
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:31,917
Good morning

474
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:33,129
Your hands, I say

475
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:36,632
But... Um...
It has to be an herbal soak

476
00:55:36,733 --> 00:55:38,326
You sure are dense

477
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:42,633
Oh... A fragrant bath coming up
Relax and enjoy...

478
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:54,410
Hello, foreman here
Yes, ma'am...

479
00:55:56,587 --> 00:55:57,611
Thank you so much!

480
00:55:57,721 --> 00:55:58,916
That's not...

481
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,456
Hey, you, wait!

482
00:56:00,557 --> 00:56:01,547
What's the trouble?

483
00:56:01,658 --> 00:56:02,921
Why, nothing at all...

484
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:04,953
We have an intruder

485
00:56:05,062 --> 00:56:05,995
Is it human?

486
00:56:06,096 --> 00:56:08,929
You figure it out
Haku's out today

487
00:56:09,199 --> 00:56:11,691
Wow. you got a really good one

488
00:56:11,802 --> 00:56:14,237
This goes to Kamaji

489
00:56:15,939 --> 00:56:17,600
Water'll be right up,
it's not too busy now

490
00:56:23,714 --> 00:56:26,649
Yank on this for hot water

491
00:56:35,459 --> 00:56:37,655
You're such a klutz

492
00:56:37,828 --> 00:56:39,922
Look at that color

493
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:42,294
That's the dried worm salts

494
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,835
With water this murky
who's gonna see the sludge

495
00:56:47,971 --> 00:56:50,804
Yank it again when it's full
It'll stop

496
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:52,902
Go ahead, let go

497
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,603
I'll get our breakfast

498
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:55,974
Sure!

499
00:57:18,268 --> 00:57:21,033
Ouch!

500
00:57:24,441 --> 00:57:27,103
Um...
The bath's not ready yet

501
00:57:32,683 --> 00:57:34,082
But, there are so many...

502
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,719
Wha...
They're for me?

503
00:57:42,025 --> 00:57:44,357
But...
I don't need this many

504
00:57:47,130 --> 00:57:48,859
No, just one

505
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:04,841
Madam!

506
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,279
It's a Stink God?!

507
00:58:06,383 --> 00:58:08,477
An Extra Large Stinker at that

508
00:58:08,585 --> 00:58:10,314
Headed straight for the bridge

509
00:58:10,420 --> 00:58:12,821
Please turn back

510
00:58:13,523 --> 00:58:16,788
Please withdraw!
The bath is closed for the night

511
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:19,586
Please withdraw, please!

512
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:22,290
Peeecee-ewy...

513
00:58:22,699 --> 00:58:26,465
Something's fishy
Didn't seem like a Stink God. to me...

514
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:29,096
Well, now that it's here,
better go greet it!

515
00:58:29,806 --> 00:58:33,333
Just try to get rid of it,
as fast as you can

516
00:58:33,944 --> 00:58:35,776
We're sorry, please retire to your rooms!
So terribly sorry!

517
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,574
Please hurry!

518
00:58:39,783 --> 00:58:41,717
Lin and Sen, Yubaba's calling

519
00:58:41,818 --> 00:58:42,580
Yes sir!

520
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:45,480
Listen, this is your first job

521
00:58:45,589 --> 00:58:48,354
You take this customer
in the big tub

522
00:58:48,625 --> 00:58:49,285
Um... um...

523
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:51,361
One peep out of you
and you're coal!

524
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:52,390
Got that?

525
00:58:52,496 --> 00:58:54,487
It has arrived

526
00:59:04,908 --> 00:59:06,899
Don't insult the customer!

527
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:18,421
Welggum to our bazzs...

528
00:59:21,825 --> 00:59:23,816
Oh...
Money... !

529
00:59:23,927 --> 00:59:26,521
Sen, hurry, take it!

530
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:27,859
Yes ma'am

531
00:59:36,173 --> 00:59:40,770
Zhow him de bazz

532
00:59:40,877 --> 00:59:42,641
Pl... Pleazze

533
01:00:01,198 --> 01:00:02,791
Sen!

534
01:00:07,104 --> 01:00:09,596
Awful...

535
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:11,640
Our food...

536
01:00:11,741 --> 01:00:13,835
Open the windows!
All of "em!

537
01:00:57,087 --> 01:00:59,749
What?
Just a minute

538
01:01:05,362 --> 01:01:06,523
Truly filthy, no?

539
01:01:06,630 --> 01:01:08,155
This is no laughing matter

540
01:01:08,265 --> 01:01:09,824
Let's see what she does

541
01:01:14,437 --> 01:01:17,031
Ah, she intends to re-fill the tub

542
01:01:17,140 --> 01:01:20,906
Oh, no, soiling the walls
with those filthy hands!

543
01:01:33,123 --> 01:01:34,955
Did you give Sen new tags?

544
01:01:35,058 --> 01:01:37,686
Never, what a waste!

545
01:02:19,102 --> 01:02:21,594
Oh no!
All that precious herbal formula!

546
01:02:47,697 --> 01:02:50,029
Sen! Sen, where are you!

547
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:51,066
Lin!

548
01:02:51,167 --> 01:02:52,328
You 0K?

549
01:02:52,435 --> 01:02:55,097
I asked Kamaji to give us
all the water he's got!

550
01:02:55,639 --> 01:02:57,698
He's sending the best
herbal soak ever!

551
01:02:58,208 --> 01:03:01,405
Thank you
He's got a thorn stuck in him

552
01:03:01,511 --> 01:03:02,501
A thorn!?

553
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:04,205
It's in so deep. it won't come out!

554
01:03:04,481 --> 01:03:07,075
Thorn!?
She said thorn!

555
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:10,252
Rally the help downstairs!

556
01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:11,115
Step on it!

557
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,214
Sen and Lin!

558
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:18,727
that's no Stink God in there!

559
01:03:20,897 --> 01:03:22,422
Grab this rope!

560
01:03:22,532 --> 01:03:23,624
Yes ma'am!

561
01:03:32,409 --> 01:03:33,899
Hold on tight!

562
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,000
Yes ma'am!

563
01:03:35,478 --> 01:03:39,073
Hustle now, and get
the women to help them

564
01:03:39,449 --> 01:03:41,110
I tied it!

565
01:03:42,218 --> 01:03:45,711
Everyone, all of you!
All together now!

566
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:48,587
Heave!

567
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:51,091
And heave!

568
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:53,625
And heave!

569
01:03:53,730 --> 01:03:55,892
And heave!

570
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:04,640
A bicycle?

571
01:04:05,275 --> 01:04:06,436
As I suspected!
Now, pull!

572
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:08,637
Now, heave!

573
01:04:08,878 --> 01:04:11,370
And heave!

574
01:04:42,979 --> 01:04:45,573
Sen, you OK!?

575
01:04:55,925 --> 01:04:58,895
Well done...

576
01:05:28,024 --> 01:05:30,118
Gold dust! Gold!
It's gold!

577
01:05:30,293 --> 01:05:32,887
Hands off!
That's company property!

578
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:36,465
Be still
Our guest is still with us

579
01:05:42,372 --> 01:05:45,364
Sen, you're in our guest's way
Get out and open the door

580
01:05:45,475 --> 01:05:47,967
Open the main gates!
He's leaving!

581
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:18,833
Sen! You did great!
You made us a bundle!

582
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:22,170
That River God's famous

583
01:06:22,278 --> 01:06:23,905
You can all learn from Sen

584
01:06:24,514 --> 01:06:26,505
Sake's on the house, tonight!

585
01:06:27,016 --> 01:06:29,713
Now! Time to hand over all
that gold you picked up!

586
01:06:43,333 --> 01:06:45,324
Want some?
I swiped it

587
01:06:45,835 --> 01:06:47,269
Thank you

588
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:49,532
Man, oh, man

589
01:06:52,108 --> 01:06:53,598
I didn't see Haku

590
01:06:53,710 --> 01:06:55,439
Not Haku again

591
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,780
He just disappears sometimes

592
01:06:59,215 --> 01:07:02,981
They say Yubaba makes
him do bad stuff

593
01:07:03,119 --> 01:07:03,950
Really...

594
01:07:04,053 --> 01:07:05,487
Lights out. Lin

595
01:07:05,588 --> 01:07:06,612
Right

596
01:07:31,814 --> 01:07:34,476
There's a town
Looks like the ocean...

597
01:07:34,751 --> 01:07:37,618
What did you expect
after all that rain

598
01:07:39,489 --> 01:07:43,483
Some day, I swear I'll get to that town
I'm gonna get out of here

599
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,280
What's wrong!

600
01:08:38,881 --> 01:08:40,371
Gold!

601
01:08:43,219 --> 01:08:46,314
Who are you?
You're no customer

602
01:08:46,422 --> 01:08:48,049
You're not allowed in there!

603
01:08:54,731 --> 01:08:57,860
Hey! It's gold, gold!
It's for me!?

604
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:05,470
You can make gold?

605
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:11,979
Gimme!

606
01:09:20,256 --> 01:09:21,917
Who goes there?

607
01:09:23,092 --> 01:09:25,356
It's way past bedtime

608
01:09:28,931 --> 01:09:32,196
Hey boss. I'm hungry

609
01:09:32,301 --> 01:09:33,496
Starving

610
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:34,468
That voice...

611
01:09:34,570 --> 01:09:36,436
There. I'll pay you now

612
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,868
I'm a customer, I want a bath!

613
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:41,569
Wake everyone up!

614
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:50,450
Mommy, Daddy. the River God
gave me this cake

615
01:09:50,553 --> 01:09:53,454
I'm sure if you eat them,
you'll turn back into people

616
01:09:57,560 --> 01:09:59,551
Dad, Mom, where are you?

617
01:09:59,962 --> 01:10:01,157
Daddy!

618
01:10:12,308 --> 01:10:13,469
Awful dream

619
01:10:14,977 --> 01:10:16,467
Lin...?

620
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:21,977
Where is everybody?

621
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,256
Wow... it really did
turn into an ocean!

622
01:10:36,599 --> 01:10:39,534
I can see where Mom and
Dad are from here

623
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,434
Kamaji's already lit the fires?

624
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:47,635
Did I sleep that long?

625
01:10:50,913 --> 01:10:53,883
The customer's waiting
Hurry it up!

626
01:10:54,016 --> 01:10:58,010
Serve everything you've
got. even leftovers!

627
01:11:00,022 --> 01:11:00,955
Sen!

628
01:11:01,057 --> 01:11:02,047
Lin

629
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:04,989
I was just going to wake you up
Look!

630
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:07,491
Real gold
He gave it to me

631
01:11:07,864 --> 01:11:10,026
This guest's a real high roller

632
01:11:10,133 --> 01:11:12,397
Please, sir. try this!

633
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,937
Taste the very best!

634
01:11:16,539 --> 01:11:19,133
Throw us some gold!

635
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:21,036
Your blessings!

636
01:11:21,144 --> 01:11:24,478
I'm starving, bring it all!

637
01:11:25,181 --> 01:11:27,548
Please sir!

638
01:11:29,152 --> 01:11:30,415
That guest...

639
01:11:30,720 --> 01:11:34,088
Come, Sen, Yubaba's still asleep
Now's your chance

640
01:11:34,557 --> 01:11:36,389
I'm going to see Kamaji

641
01:11:36,993 --> 01:11:39,189
I wouldn't go right now

642
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:41,559
He's in a foul mood
‘cause they woke him up

643
01:11:41,664 --> 01:11:43,496
Let's go back for more, Lin

644
01:12:08,724 --> 01:12:12,058
What if I don't recognize
my parents?

645
01:12:12,862 --> 01:12:15,627
I hope Dad hasn't
gotten too fat

646
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:45,383
The dragon I saw before

647
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,396
It's coming this way!

648
01:12:50,132 --> 01:12:51,463
What are they?
Not birds

649
01:13:02,845 --> 01:13:05,940
Fight back, Haku!
This way

650
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:06,879
Haku!

651
01:13:07,550 --> 01:13:08,642
Haku!

652
01:13:26,836 --> 01:13:29,168
Oh...
It's just paper...

653
01:13:57,466 --> 01:13:59,628
Haku?
That is you, right?

654
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:09,142
Are you hurt?
Those paper birds are gone

655
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:10,508
You're safe, now

656
01:14:23,726 --> 01:14:25,455
He's going to Yubaba...

657
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:28,497
Oh, no!
He'll die!

658
01:14:36,405 --> 01:14:40,740
The very richest man
in the whole wide world

659
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:45,045
That man himself,
is now approaching

660
01:14:46,282 --> 01:14:48,376
Welcome!

661
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:50,816
Time to beg for tips
Start begging

662
01:14:50,920 --> 01:14:53,855
Please, sir! Over here!

663
01:14:53,956 --> 01:14:56,721
Now beg

664
01:14:56,826 --> 01:14:58,521
Now beg

665
01:14:58,627 --> 01:15:00,595
Gold springs from his palms

666
01:15:01,297 --> 01:15:04,528
Toss some this way, sir!

667
01:15:08,537 --> 01:15:09,971
Hey. what are you doing?

668
01:15:10,072 --> 01:15:11,062
I'm going upstairs

669
01:15:11,173 --> 01:15:13,164
No, you don't
What's this!

670
01:15:13,876 --> 01:15:15,071
It's blood!

671
01:15:19,048 --> 01:15:21,278
Move, move
Let our guest through

672
01:15:22,885 --> 01:15:24,876
Thank you for helping me before

673
01:15:25,054 --> 01:15:27,489
Don't just stand there...

674
01:15:49,412 --> 01:15:51,073
I don't want any
Don't need any

675
01:15:54,016 --> 01:15:56,348
I'm busy, please excuse me

676
01:16:07,963 --> 01:16:10,830
Quiet! Quiet down!

677
01:16:11,534 --> 01:16:13,195
Back, get back!

678
01:16:13,602 --> 01:16:15,696
Please forgive her manners

679
01:16:15,805 --> 01:16:19,400
After all, the girl is only human
and new here...

680
01:16:21,777 --> 01:16:23,609
Wipe that smile off your face

681
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:24,543
I saw that look

682
01:16:24,647 --> 01:16:26,137
Why, I would never...

683
01:16:31,053 --> 01:16:33,385
He ate them!

684
01:18:00,376 --> 01:18:01,866
Yubaba?

685
01:19:14,450 --> 01:19:17,078
We're in a fine mess. now

686
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:19,814
Actually, he's a No Face

687
01:19:19,989 --> 01:19:21,889
That's right, a No Face!

688
01:19:22,224 --> 01:19:25,091
Your greed attracted
quite a guest, all right

689
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:28,893
Don't do anything stupid
until I get down there

690
01:19:29,465 --> 01:19:31,900
Look, the carpet's a mess

691
01:19:32,001 --> 01:19:34,265
Get Haku out of here

692
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:36,202
He's no use to me now

693
01:19:58,727 --> 01:20:01,719
Sleeping outside of
your crib again?

694
01:20:05,734 --> 01:20:10,001
Oh, I'm sorry, you were
sleeping like such a good baby

695
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:12,938
Baba still has work to do

696
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:18,643
Go back to sleep now
Good baby

697
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:48,601
Ouch, let go!

698
01:20:49,044 --> 01:20:50,910
Oh, thank you for helping me

699
01:20:51,013 --> 01:20:54,347
But I'm in a hurry
Please let me go

700
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:56,782
You came here to make me sick

701
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:59,845
Bad germs outside, bad

702
01:21:00,789 --> 01:21:04,623
I'm a human
Maybe you never saw one before

703
01:21:04,893 --> 01:21:07,225
You'll get sick out there

704
01:21:07,329 --> 01:21:09,354
Stay here and play with me

705
01:21:09,565 --> 01:21:11,158
Are you sick?

706
01:21:11,266 --> 01:21:14,099
I'm in here 'cause
I'll get sick outside

707
01:21:14,203 --> 01:21:16,695
It's staying in here that'll
make you sick!

708
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:20,571
You see, somebody I really
care about got hurt very badly

709
01:21:20,676 --> 01:21:22,337
So I've got to go right now

710
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:23,741
Please let go of my arm!

711
01:21:24,012 --> 01:21:25,673
If you go. I'll start crying

712
01:21:25,781 --> 01:21:29,240
If I cry, Baba will come
and kill you

713
01:21:29,351 --> 01:21:31,012
I'll break your little arm

714
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:32,315
That hurts!

715
01:21:32,421 --> 01:21:34,913
Please, I'll come
play with you later

716
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:36,649
No, I wanna play now!

717
01:21:40,696 --> 01:21:42,858
That's blood! Get it!
It's blood!

718
01:21:54,443 --> 01:21:56,207
Haku!

719
01:21:56,311 --> 01:21:58,405
Stop, go away!
Scat. scat!

720
01:21:58,514 --> 01:21:59,538
Haku! It is you, right?!

721
01:21:59,648 --> 01:22:01,138
Hang on!

722
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,779
Be quiet!
Haku!

723
01:22:08,257 --> 01:22:10,521
Shoo, shoo. go away

724
01:22:13,228 --> 01:22:14,559
Oh, no!

725
01:22:29,645 --> 01:22:31,409
I'm not afraid of blood

726
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,379
I'll ery if you don't play

727
01:22:33,482 --> 01:22:35,382
Please be a good boy and wait

728
01:22:35,818 --> 01:22:38,810
If you don't play with me,
I'l ery...

729
01:22:40,823 --> 01:22:42,257
Please, wait!

730
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:45,554
What a racket
Simmer down

731
01:22:46,929 --> 01:22:49,762
You're a little butterball,
aren't you?

732
01:22:57,172 --> 01:22:59,436
Guess I'm still a little transparent

733
01:22:59,541 --> 01:23:00,303
Baba

734
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:05,105
Oh, dear, can't you even tell
me from your own mother?

735
01:23:13,288 --> 01:23:16,223
There, that gives you
a little more freedom

736
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:17,087
Let's see now...

737
01:23:17,459 --> 01:23:19,393
What shall we turn you into?

738
01:23:37,479 --> 01:23:40,210
This is our little secret
You tell anyone,

739
01:23:40,315 --> 01:23:42,306
I'll rip your mouth out

740
01:23:43,886 --> 01:23:45,047
Who are you?

741
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,655
Yubaba's twin sister

742
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:51,750
Thanks to you, I've had a good
look at this place, enjoyed myself

743
01:23:51,860 --> 01:23:53,555
Now hand over the dragon

744
01:23:53,795 --> 01:23:56,196
What do you want with Haku?
He's badly hurt

745
01:23:56,565 --> 01:23:59,557
That dragon's a thief,
my sister's lackey

746
01:23:59,668 --> 01:24:02,831
Stole a precious seal
from my house

747
01:24:02,938 --> 01:24:05,703
Haku would never!
He's so kind

748
01:24:06,241 --> 01:24:09,836
All dragons are kind
Kind and stupid

749
01:24:09,945 --> 01:24:14,473
Eager to learn my sister's
magical ways

750
01:24:14,917 --> 01:24:18,683
This boy here will do anything
that greedy woman wants

751
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,881
Move away

752
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:23,481
It's too late for him anyway

753
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:26,755
The seal was protected
by a charm...

754
01:24:26,862 --> 01:24:28,956
Any who try to steal it must die

755
01:24:29,665 --> 01:24:31,429
No, you can't!

756
01:24:38,941 --> 01:24:40,966
What's gotten into them?

757
01:24:41,076 --> 01:24:43,704
Hey there, cut it out!
Go back to your room

758
01:24:51,553 --> 01:24:53,817
Oh, dear, seems I was careless

759
01:24:53,989 --> 01:24:55,320
Haku!
Oh. no!

760
01:25:16,745 --> 01:25:17,906
Haku!

761
01:25:45,941 --> 01:25:47,602
What on earth is this!

762
01:25:47,709 --> 01:25:49,108
Hey!
Just wait

763
01:25:52,114 --> 01:25:53,343
Haku!

764
01:25:56,852 --> 01:25:58,445
Does it hurt?

765
01:26:02,090 --> 01:26:04,184
This is serious

766
01:26:06,194 --> 01:26:07,491
Haku, don't give up!

767
01:26:07,596 --> 01:26:09,360
Oh, no, he's going to die!

768
01:26:09,865 --> 01:26:12,630
There's something inside him
that's killing him

769
01:26:12,734 --> 01:26:13,895
Inside him!?

770
01:26:14,002 --> 01:26:17,199
It's a good spell
Nothing I can do

771
01:26:17,539 --> 01:26:20,873
Haku, the River God
gave me this

772
01:26:20,976 --> 01:26:23,070
Eat them, maybe they'll help

773
01:26:25,380 --> 01:26:27,610
Haku, open your mouth!

774
01:26:27,883 --> 01:26:30,477
Please. Haku, eat it!

775
01:26:32,220 --> 01:26:33,984
See. they're safe

776
01:26:34,322 --> 01:26:36,347
Are those the herbal cakes?

777
01:26:36,658 --> 01:26:39,650
Open
That's a good boy...

778
01:26:43,498 --> 01:26:45,262
That's it

779
01:26:45,367 --> 01:26:46,801
Swallow!

780
01:27:05,187 --> 01:27:06,518
He spit it out!
That's it!

781
01:27:19,267 --> 01:27:20,428
The seal!

782
01:27:20,602 --> 01:27:22,434
It got away!
There! Over there!

783
01:27:42,224 --> 01:27:44,818
Gross, gross, Sen!
Totally gross

784
01:27:49,064 --> 01:27:49,997
Gross out!

785
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:52,863
Haku took this from
Yubaba's sister, Kamaji

786
01:27:53,235 --> 01:27:55,829
From Zeniba?
A witch's seal!

787
01:27:56,338 --> 01:27:58,432
Precious loot, I'd say

788
01:28:01,042 --> 01:28:02,976
Oh...
I knew it was Haku!

789
01:28:03,078 --> 01:28:04,671
Look, Kamaji, it's Haku!

790
01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:07,872
Haku!

791
01:28:07,983 --> 01:28:09,417
Haku! Haku!

792
01:28:11,820 --> 01:28:13,811
Kamaji! He's not breathing

793
01:28:13,922 --> 01:28:17,449
Yes he is, but he's still
gravely ill from the spell...

794
01:28:26,768 --> 01:28:29,760
That should calm him some

795
01:28:32,174 --> 01:28:37,112
Haku turned up one day here,
just like you

796
01:28:37,212 --> 01:28:40,045
Said he wanted to learn magic

797
01:28:40,315 --> 01:28:42,340
I didn't approve...

798
01:28:42,450 --> 01:28:43,747
becoming a sorcerer's apprentice...

799
01:28:43,852 --> 01:28:46,116
I warned him,

800
01:28:46,521 --> 01:28:49,013
but he wouldn't listen

801
01:28:49,291 --> 01:28:50,952
Said he had nowhere left to go

802
01:28:51,059 --> 01:28:54,586
Signed up to be
Yubaba's apprentice

803
01:28:55,096 --> 01:28:58,191
As time went by,
he turned increasingly pale,

804
01:28:58,300 --> 01:29:01,235
and his eyes took on
a sharp gleam

805
01:29:03,471 --> 01:29:07,169
Kamaji, I'm going to give
this back to Yubaba's sister

806
01:29:07,375 --> 01:29:11,141
Give it back, apologize,
and ask her to help Haku

807
01:29:11,246 --> 01:29:13,078
Tell me where she lives

808
01:29:13,548 --> 01:29:15,880
Go to Zeniba's?

809
01:29:16,318 --> 01:29:18,252
She's one scary sorceress

810
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,115
Please

811
01:29:19,387 --> 01:29:21,651
Haku helped me

812
01:29:21,756 --> 01:29:23,349
Now I want to help him

813
01:29:24,960 --> 01:29:28,294
You can get there all right...

814
01:29:28,396 --> 01:29:30,330
But getting back...

815
01:29:30,665 --> 01:29:32,429
Wait here

816
01:29:34,836 --> 01:29:38,101
Let's see now...
It's around here, I think...

817
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:41,832
Everyone, I need my shoes
and my clothes, please

818
01:29:50,252 --> 01:29:53,244
Sen! I hunted for you
everywhere!

819
01:29:55,857 --> 01:29:56,949
Lin

820
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,720
That's Haku
What happened here...

821
01:30:00,428 --> 01:30:01,418
Who are these guys?

822
01:30:02,530 --> 01:30:04,794
My new friends

823
01:30:05,066 --> 01:30:08,229
Yubaba's tearing the place
apart looking for you

824
01:30:08,436 --> 01:30:12,031
The big tipper turned out to
be a horrible monster. No Face

825
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:14,975
Yubaba says you led him here

826
01:30:18,446 --> 01:30:19,572
Maybe I did

827
01:30:19,681 --> 01:30:21,843
You serious?!

828
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:23,782
I just thought
he was a customer...

829
01:30:23,885 --> 01:30:26,855
He's already swallowed
two Frogs and a Snail!

830
01:30:27,289 --> 01:30:30,281
Found it!
Here it is, Sen!

831
01:30:30,725 --> 01:30:32,386
We're busy, gramps

832
01:30:32,494 --> 01:30:34,485
You can use this

833
01:30:35,463 --> 01:30:38,296
That's a train ticket
Where'd you get that?

834
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,892
I've had it for 40 years

835
01:30:41,002 --> 01:30:44,666
Now listen, it's the 6th stop,
called Swamp Bottom

836
01:30:44,973 --> 01:30:46,099
Swamp Bottom?

837
01:30:46,207 --> 01:30:48,141
That's right, it's the 6th stop

838
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:49,176
The 6th stop

839
01:30:49,411 --> 01:30:53,245
Make sure you get it right
There used to be a return train,

840
01:30:53,348 --> 01:30:55,282
but these days
it's a one-way ride

841
01:30:55,383 --> 01:30:56,976
Still interested?

842
01:30:57,085 --> 01:31:00,350
Yup
I'll walk back, along the tracks

843
01:31:02,057 --> 01:31:03,821
But what about Yubaba?

844
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:05,393
I'll go to her now

845
01:31:05,994 --> 01:31:09,760
I promise I'll be back, Haku
You can't die

846
01:31:10,432 --> 01:31:12,093
What's going on here?

847
01:31:12,667 --> 01:31:15,102
Don't you see?
It's called... Love...

848
01:31:23,011 --> 01:31:25,343
It just keeps getting bigger!

849
01:31:25,547 --> 01:31:27,140
Don't let it swallow me!

850
01:31:27,248 --> 01:31:28,147
Here she comes!

851
01:31:35,690 --> 01:31:37,180
Thank goodness, Sen!

852
01:31:37,292 --> 01:31:39,727
Yubaba can't control him

853
01:31:42,697 --> 01:31:46,531
There's no need to get upset
I'm sure Sen will turn up

854
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:49,437
Where's Sen! I want Sen!

855
01:31:49,771 --> 01:31:51,432
Go. hurry

856
01:31:56,778 --> 01:31:58,712
Yubaba, it's Sen

857
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:00,303
Where were you!

858
01:32:00,415 --> 01:32:04,750
Sen has come, dear guest
We'll be right with you

859
01:32:05,787 --> 01:32:08,882
What took you so long!
This is a complete disaster!

860
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:11,789
Suck up to him and squeeze
all his gold out of him

861
01:32:15,797 --> 01:32:18,129
What's that filthy rat?!

862
01:32:19,968 --> 01:32:22,300
Don't you recognize him?

863
01:32:22,570 --> 01:32:25,335
Of course not,
how disgusting!

864
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:26,871
Now, in you go

865
01:32:28,410 --> 01:32:30,674
Call if you need us

866
01:32:31,579 --> 01:32:33,843
Is she all right
in there by herself?

867
01:32:34,115 --> 01:32:35,947
Want to take her place?

868
01:32:56,438 --> 01:32:59,601
Try this, it's yummy

869
01:33:01,509 --> 01:33:05,969
Want some gold?
I'm not giving it to anybody else

870
01:33:10,018 --> 01:33:11,782
Come over here, Sen

871
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:15,481
What is it you want?
You can tell me

872
01:33:15,857 --> 01:33:17,791
Where did you come from?

873
01:33:17,892 --> 01:33:20,224
There's someplace
I have to go right away

874
01:33:22,630 --> 01:33:25,122
You should go back
where you came from

875
01:33:25,233 --> 01:33:28,225
You can't help me
with what I want

876
01:33:30,138 --> 01:33:33,130
Where's your home?
Don't you have a mom and dad?

877
01:33:33,975 --> 01:33:37,240
I don't wanna...
Don't wanna...

878
01:33:38,246 --> 01:33:42,012
I'm lonely. lonely...

879
01:33:42,817 --> 01:33:44,307
Can't you get back home?

880
01:33:44,719 --> 01:33:48,246
I want Sen, want Sen

881
01:33:48,890 --> 01:33:49,982
Take the gold

882
01:33:50,558 --> 01:33:51,719
Are you going to eat me?

883
01:33:51,826 --> 01:33:52,657
Take it!

884
01:33:52,760 --> 01:33:53,591
Take it!

885
01:34:02,904 --> 01:34:05,566
If you're going to eat me,
have these first

886
01:34:06,241 --> 01:34:10,235
I was saving them for my parents
but you can have them

887
01:34:31,099 --> 01:34:32,430
Sen!

888
01:34:34,936 --> 01:34:38,668
Girl!
What did you feed me?!

889
01:34:53,955 --> 01:34:55,286
Out of my way!

890
01:34:56,457 --> 01:34:58,289
Not on my premises!

891
01:35:11,706 --> 01:35:13,140
Over here

892
01:35:13,908 --> 01:35:15,239
Here!

893
01:36:00,021 --> 01:36:01,682
You'll pay for this!

894
01:36:19,140 --> 01:36:21,165
Sen, over here!

895
01:36:37,558 --> 01:36:39,822
There he is
Over here!

896
01:36:39,927 --> 01:36:41,554
Don't call him over

897
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:49,064
He's only bad in the bath house
He needs to get out of there

898
01:36:49,237 --> 01:36:51,399
But take him where?

899
01:36:51,506 --> 01:36:52,496
I don't know...

900
01:36:52,607 --> 01:36:57,067
You don't know...
He's following us

901
01:37:14,629 --> 01:37:15,619
From here, you walk

902
01:37:15,730 --> 01:37:16,720
OK

903
01:37:16,831 --> 01:37:18,595
You'll find the station

904
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:20,134
Thank you

905
01:37:20,768 --> 01:37:22,361
You better come back!

906
01:37:22,603 --> 01:37:23,593
OK

907
01:37:27,775 --> 01:37:31,268
I know I called you a klutz!

908
01:37:31,379 --> 01:37:32,938
I take it back!

909
01:37:41,122 --> 01:37:45,252
No Face, if you so much as
touch that girl. you'll pay for it!

910
01:37:48,563 --> 01:37:49,894
There it is

911
01:38:01,476 --> 01:38:03,843
Train's coming, here we go

912
01:38:27,335 --> 01:38:29,565
I'm riding to Swamp Bottom

913
01:38:36,177 --> 01:38:37,838
You want to come, too?

914
01:38:39,347 --> 01:38:41,315
Him too, please

915
01:39:21,889 --> 01:39:23,220
Come here

916
01:39:23,825 --> 01:39:25,486
Behave yourself, OK?

917
01:41:27,682 --> 01:41:29,116
Kamaji

918
01:41:31,519 --> 01:41:34,113
Oh, Haku...
You're awake

919
01:41:34,221 --> 01:41:35,746
Where's Sen?

920
01:41:36,190 --> 01:41:38,750
What happened, please tell me

921
01:41:39,026 --> 01:41:41,859
Don't you remember anything?

922
01:41:42,463 --> 01:41:44,557
Just little pieces

923
01:41:44,765 --> 01:41:47,860
Chihiro kept calling my name
in the darkness

924
01:41:48,135 --> 01:41:52,129
I followed her voice and
woke up lying here...

925
01:41:52,540 --> 01:41:54,531
Chihiro, huh...

926
01:41:54,642 --> 01:41:57,407
Her real name's Chihiro?

927
01:41:58,646 --> 01:42:01,513
Can't beat the power of love...

928
01:42:05,219 --> 01:42:08,314
This gold hardly
covers the damage

929
01:42:08,422 --> 01:42:11,323
That fool, Sen!
She just cost me a fortune

930
01:42:11,826 --> 01:42:15,558
But, Sen did save us, after all

931
01:42:15,663 --> 01:42:16,824
Silence!

932
01:42:16,931 --> 01:42:19,366
She started it all,

933
01:42:19,467 --> 01:42:21,799
and now she's run away

934
01:42:21,902 --> 01:42:24,530
Even abandoned
her own parents!

935
01:42:25,239 --> 01:42:29,039
Her parents must be fine fat pigs by now
Turn them into bacon or ham

936
01:42:29,410 --> 01:42:31,037
Please wait

937
01:42:32,179 --> 01:42:33,305
Master Haku!

938
01:42:33,447 --> 01:42:35,643
What, you still alive?

939
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:41,385
You still can't see that
you've lost something precious?

940
01:42:41,922 --> 01:42:44,721
You've gotten pretty fresh

941
01:42:44,859 --> 01:42:47,294
Since when do you talk that way?

942
01:43:38,979 --> 01:43:40,947
Baby...

943
01:43:46,921 --> 01:43:48,548
Baby!

944
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:49,656
It's nothing but sand!

945
01:43:49,824 --> 01:43:52,623
Baby!

946
01:43:53,094 --> 01:43:56,894
Where are you, baby!

947
01:43:57,264 --> 01:43:59,892
Come out, please!

948
01:44:00,601 --> 01:44:01,864
Baby!

949
01:44:05,172 --> 01:44:07,470
Baby, baby!

950
01:44:12,113 --> 01:44:16,573
You!

951
01:44:17,852 --> 01:44:21,186
Tell me!

952
01:44:22,690 --> 01:44:26,820
Where did you hide my baby?!

953
01:44:27,294 --> 01:44:29,092
He's with Zeniba

954
01:44:29,230 --> 01:44:31,198
Zeniba?

955
01:44:52,219 --> 01:44:55,951
I get it, that evil witch

956
01:44:56,090 --> 01:44:58,718
So she thinks she's beaten me

957
01:45:00,394 --> 01:45:02,590
So, what's your plan?

958
01:45:03,030 --> 01:45:05,192
I'll bring the baby back

959
01:45:05,332 --> 01:45:09,565
But in exchange, return Sen and
her parents to the human world

960
01:45:09,837 --> 01:45:12,101
And what becomes of you?!

961
01:45:12,406 --> 01:45:16,104
Let's say I tear you to pieces
after sending them back!

962
01:46:02,957 --> 01:46:05,016
I think this is the right stop...

963
01:46:05,893 --> 01:46:07,190
Let's go

964
01:46:34,021 --> 01:46:35,921
You can ride on my shoulder

965
01:47:54,368 --> 01:47:56,097
Come in

966
01:48:00,941 --> 01:48:02,739
Excuse us

967
01:48:04,712 --> 01:48:07,113
Well. hurry up and come in, then

968
01:48:07,614 --> 01:48:08,911
C'mon

969
01:48:12,219 --> 01:48:14,017
So you all made it

970
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:14,712
Um...

971
01:48:14,855 --> 01:48:16,584
Have a seat

972
01:48:16,724 --> 01:48:19,125
I'll make you some tea

973
01:48:24,798 --> 01:48:28,962
Zeniba, Haku stole this from you
I brought it back

974
01:48:32,306 --> 01:48:34,707
Do you know what this is?

975
01:48:35,075 --> 01:48:38,045
No, but I know it's very precious

976
01:48:38,178 --> 01:48:41,739
I'm here to apologize for Haku
I'm sorry

977
01:48:42,416 --> 01:48:45,716
You felt fine while you held it?

978
01:48:45,853 --> 01:48:46,752
What?

979
01:48:46,887 --> 01:48:49,549
What's this?
The spell is gone

980
01:48:50,758 --> 01:48:53,887
I'm sorry
I stepped on that strange bug

981
01:48:54,028 --> 01:48:55,826
that was on the seal
and squashed it

982
01:48:56,397 --> 01:48:58,525
Squashed it!

983
01:49:00,601 --> 01:49:03,901
You know, my sister snuck
that bug into the dragon,

984
01:49:04,038 --> 01:49:06,837
so she could control
her apprentice

985
01:49:06,974 --> 01:49:09,466
Squashed it!

986
01:49:12,279 --> 01:49:14,008
You sit too

987
01:49:14,148 --> 01:49:16,879
You're No Face, aren't you?
You sit, too

988
01:49:17,918 --> 01:49:21,582
Oh, um, please turn
them back into themselves

989
01:49:21,722 --> 01:49:24,783
Why my dears,
the spell's long broken

990
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:27,326
You can turn yourselves back

991
01:49:34,635 --> 01:49:38,435
My sister and I are two halves of
a whole, but we really don't get along

992
01:49:38,572 --> 01:49:41,132
You've seen what
bad taste she has

993
01:49:41,275 --> 01:49:44,336
Sorceress twins are
just a recipe for trouble

994
01:49:48,382 --> 01:49:52,842
I'd like to help you, dear
but there's nothing I can do

995
01:49:52,986 --> 01:49:54,954
It's one of our rules here

996
01:49:55,489 --> 01:49:58,459
You've got to take care of your
parents and that dragon boyfriend

997
01:49:58,592 --> 01:50:00,219
of yours, on your own

998
01:50:00,360 --> 01:50:03,193
But, um, can't you
even give me a hint?

999
01:50:03,664 --> 01:50:07,225
I feel like Haku and I met,
a long time ago

1000
01:50:07,367 --> 01:50:09,199
In that case, it's easy

1001
01:50:09,570 --> 01:50:12,198
Nothing that happens,
is ever forgotten,

1002
01:50:12,339 --> 01:50:14,467
even if you
can't remember it

1003
01:50:15,843 --> 01:50:19,143
It's already late
Why don't you stay the night?

1004
01:50:19,580 --> 01:50:22,379
You boys give me a hand

1005
01:50:28,522 --> 01:50:30,490
Keep at it

1006
01:50:33,527 --> 01:50:37,725
That's right, you're terrific
You're a big help...

1007
01:50:38,599 --> 01:50:41,830
A magic one
won't do the trick

1008
01:50:43,203 --> 01:50:47,504
Pull it through there...
And do it again

1009
01:50:47,741 --> 01:50:50,369
I really have to
go home, granny

1010
01:50:51,011 --> 01:50:54,470
Haku could die while
I'm just sitting here...

1011
01:50:54,681 --> 01:50:58,174
They might eat my mom and dad!

1012
01:51:00,387 --> 01:51:03,118
Just wait a little longer

1013
01:51:03,257 --> 01:51:04,725
There we are

1014
01:51:05,626 --> 01:51:07,856
Use it tie back your hair

1015
01:51:12,966 --> 01:51:13,592
It's so pretty

1016
01:51:13,901 --> 01:51:18,737
It'll protect you
I made it from the thread they spun

1017
01:51:19,072 --> 01:51:20,631
Thank you

1018
01:51:29,917 --> 01:51:33,751
What good timing
We've got another guest. let him in

1019
01:51:33,887 --> 01:51:34,945
Sure

1020
01:51:48,268 --> 01:51:49,292
Haku!

1021
01:51:50,604 --> 01:51:52,163
Haku!

1022
01:51:52,606 --> 01:51:54,165
Thank goodness

1023
01:51:54,508 --> 01:51:56,977
Aren't you hurt?
You sure you're 0K?

1024
01:51:57,277 --> 01:51:58,176
Thank goodness

1025
01:52:00,113 --> 01:52:02,343
Good timing, I'd say

1026
01:52:03,016 --> 01:52:05,485
Look, granny, Haku's alive

1027
01:52:06,019 --> 01:52:10,149
Haku, I no longer blame
you for what you did

1028
01:52:10,290 --> 01:52:13,590
Just be sure you protect the girl

1029
01:52:14,027 --> 01:52:16,928
OK, boys, time you went home

1030
01:52:17,064 --> 01:52:19,123
Come again soon

1031
01:52:19,866 --> 01:52:24,201
You, stick around
and be my helper

1032
01:52:26,707 --> 01:52:27,606
Granny!

1033
01:52:28,308 --> 01:52:30,436
Thank you, I'm going now

1034
01:52:30,577 --> 01:52:33,638
I'm sure you can
manage everything

1035
01:52:33,780 --> 01:52:37,011
My real name is Chihiro

1036
01:52:37,150 --> 01:52:39,619
Chihiro...what a nice name

1037
01:52:39,753 --> 01:52:41,721
Take good care of it,
it's yours

1038
01:52:41,855 --> 01:52:42,413
1 will!

1039
01:52:42,556 --> 01:52:44,354
Off you go

1040
01:52:46,059 --> 01:52:49,120
Thank you, granny
Good bye

1041
01:53:38,278 --> 01:53:39,905
Listen, Haku

1042
01:53:40,047 --> 01:53:43,574
I don't remember it, but
my mom told me...

1043
01:53:44,017 --> 01:53:47,578
Once, when I was little,
I fell into a river

1044
01:53:48,121 --> 01:53:51,751
She said they'd drained it
and built things on top

1045
01:53:52,125 --> 01:53:54,253
But I've just remembered

1046
01:53:55,395 --> 01:53:57,022
The river was called...

1047
01:53:57,464 --> 01:54:00,593
Its name was the Kohaku River

1048
01:54:01,234 --> 01:54:04,431
Your real name is Kohaku

1049
01:54:25,826 --> 01:54:27,294
Chihiro, thank you

1050
01:54:27,427 --> 01:54:30,590
My real name is
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi

1051
01:54:31,164 --> 01:54:32,131
Nigihayami?

1052
01:54:32,265 --> 01:54:34,495
Nigihayami Kohaku Nushi

1053
01:54:34,634 --> 01:54:37,103
What a name
Sounds like a god

1054
01:54:37,504 --> 01:54:41,907
I remember too, how
you fell into me as a child

1055
01:54:42,042 --> 01:54:43,669
You had dropped your shoe

1056
01:54:44,177 --> 01:54:48,307
Yes, you carried me
to shallow water. Kohaku

1057
01:54:49,182 --> 01:54:50,343
I'm so grateful...

1058
01:55:23,216 --> 01:55:24,615
They're back!

1059
01:55:37,898 --> 01:55:40,868
You brought Baby back
with you, right?

1060
01:55:43,503 --> 01:55:44,402
Baba!

1061
01:55:44,538 --> 01:55:48,941
You're not hurt?
What a terrible time you had

1062
01:55:50,210 --> 01:55:53,271
Baby, you're standing all by yourself?
When?

1063
01:55:53,914 --> 01:55:56,042
Yubaba, you promised

1064
01:55:56,183 --> 01:55:59,016
Please return Chihiro's family
to the human world

1065
01:55:59,586 --> 01:56:02,055
Not so fast

1066
01:56:02,189 --> 01:56:05,159
This world has rules, you know!

1067
01:56:05,926 --> 01:56:07,087
Shut up!

1068
01:56:07,227 --> 01:56:09,719
Baba, what a miser
Just can it

1069
01:56:10,096 --> 01:56:12,588
Baby had such a good time

1070
01:56:13,099 --> 01:56:15,898
But, a rule's a rule

1071
01:56:16,036 --> 01:56:18,300
Otherwise I can't break the spell

1072
01:56:18,605 --> 01:56:21,666
If you make Sen cry,
I won't like you anymore, Baba

1073
01:56:22,209 --> 01:56:23,335
Why that's...

1074
01:56:23,477 --> 01:56:24,876
Granny

1075
01:56:25,011 --> 01:56:26,172
Granny!?

1076
01:56:26,613 --> 01:56:28,604
I'm coming to you

1077
01:56:40,060 --> 01:56:42,358
Haku told me all about the rule

1078
01:56:42,496 --> 01:56:44,294
Least you've got guts

1079
01:56:44,431 --> 01:56:47,662
Here's your contract
Come over here

1080
01:56:47,801 --> 01:56:50,202
I won't be a minute, Baby

1081
01:56:50,971 --> 01:56:52,268
Don't worry

1082
01:56:56,743 --> 01:57:00,543
See if you can guess
which of them are yours

1083
01:57:09,923 --> 01:57:11,391
You only get one guess

1084
01:57:11,525 --> 01:57:14,051
Get it right, and you're all free

1085
01:57:26,006 --> 01:57:29,567
Granny, this is no good
My parents aren't here

1086
01:57:29,943 --> 01:57:33,311
Not here?!
That's your answer?

1087
01:57:34,948 --> 01:57:35,915
Yes

1088
01:57:38,785 --> 01:57:41,982
Bingo!

1089
01:57:42,122 --> 01:57:44,614
Thatta girl!
Right on!

1090
01:57:48,528 --> 01:57:49,825
Thank you, everyone

1091
01:57:49,963 --> 01:57:53,194
Go! You win
Just get out of here!

1092
01:57:53,700 --> 01:57:55,600
Thank you for everything

1093
01:57:56,303 --> 01:57:57,600
Good bye

1094
01:57:58,371 --> 01:57:59,429
Thank you

1095
01:57:59,573 --> 01:58:00,597
Come and see us

1096
01:58:00,974 --> 01:58:01,532
Haku

1097
01:58:01,675 --> 01:58:02,642
Let's go

1098
01:58:03,376 --> 01:58:04,605
Where are Mom and Dad?

1099
01:58:04,744 --> 01:58:05,939
They've gone on ahead

1100
01:58:13,553 --> 01:58:14,850
There's no water!

1101
01:58:14,988 --> 01:58:16,478
I can't go any farther

1102
01:58:16,990 --> 01:58:19,322
Go back the way
you came, Chihiro

1103
01:58:19,459 --> 01:58:22,485
But don't ever look back
Not until you're out of the tunnel

1104
01:58:22,729 --> 01:58:24,754
What about you. Haku?

1105
01:58:25,231 --> 01:58:28,030
I'll speak to Yubaba
Quit my apprenticeship

1106
01:58:28,168 --> 01:58:30,637
I'm fine, now that I have
my name back

1107
01:58:31,237 --> 01:58:33,035
I'll go back to my world, too

1108
01:58:33,173 --> 01:58:34,572
Can we meet again?

1109
01:58:34,708 --> 01:58:35,504
I'm sure

1110
01:58:35,642 --> 01:58:36,200
Promise

1111
01:58:36,343 --> 01:58:37,242
Promise

1112
01:58:37,377 --> 01:58:39,846
Now go, and don't look back

1113
01:59:02,602 --> 01:59:04,092
Chihiro!

1114
01:59:04,537 --> 01:59:07,097
Where have you been?
Hurry up

1115
01:59:10,710 --> 01:59:12,508
Mom! Dad!

1116
01:59:12,646 --> 01:59:14,375
You can't just run off like that

1117
01:59:14,514 --> 01:59:15,811
Away we go

1118
01:59:16,282 --> 01:59:18,410
Mom, are you sure you're OK?

1119
01:59:18,551 --> 01:59:22,784
What? I'm sure the moving
van's there by now

1120
01:59:32,198 --> 01:59:34,428
Hurry along. Chihiro

1121
01:59:43,143 --> 01:59:44,872
Watch your step

1122
01:59:45,011 --> 01:59:48,311
You'll make me trip, Chihiro
clinging like that

1123
02:00:00,560 --> 02:00:02,028
The end of the tunnel

1124
02:00:02,429 --> 02:00:03,658

02:00:06,166 --> 02:00:08,066

1127
02:00:09,169 --> 02:00:11,638
It's all dusty inside, too

1128
02:00:11,771 --> 02:00:12,567
Some kind of joke?

1129
02:00:12,706 --> 02:00:13,764
You think?

1130
02:00:13,907 --> 02:00:16,376
I told you not to stop here

1131
02:00:21,948 --> 02:00:24,417
OK. let's go

02:00:25,685 --> 02:00:27,915
