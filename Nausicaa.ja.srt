20

21
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,539
誰？

22
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,914
何かしら

23
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,383

24
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:12,457

25
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,019
誰かが虫に襲われてる！

26
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,830
あっ　ごめん！

27
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,747

きっとあの抜け殻の主だわ

31
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,531
あっちに逃げては駄目だ

32
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,502
気がついて

33
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,970
答えた！こっちへ来る

34
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,070

35
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,566

38
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,581
この先はお前の世界じゃないのよ

39
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,450
ね、いい子だから

40
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,386
怒りに我忘れてる

41
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,518
鎮めなきゃ

42
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,651
閃光でオームは目を回した

43
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,924
虫笛

44
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,891
オーム、目を醒まして

45
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,061
森へ帰ろう

46
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,214
気がついたわ

47
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,194
オームが森へ帰ってゆく

48
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,968
光玉と虫笛だけでオームを
鎮めてしまうとは

49

ナウシカ。見間違えたぞ

51
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,057
一年半振りですもの！
父が喜びます

52
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,820

いいえ、父がまだまだだって

55

Oh, yes. I forgot all about
this little fellow.

56
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,765
He's the reason I got in
trouble with the Ohm.

57
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,742
Wow, is that a fox-squirrel?
I've never seen one.

58
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:00,845
I hadn't, either.

59
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:03,879
I saw an insect carrying him off,
and I mistook him for a human baby.

60
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,380
I had no choice but to use my gun.

61
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:08,248
Oh. So, that's why the Ohm
was so angry with you.

62
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,388
He's quite spirited.

63
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:12,286
Apparently, he didn't inhale
too much of the jungle's poison.

64
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:15,052
Better not touch him.
Even the babies are vicious.

65
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,218
Come on.

66
00:13:16,396 --> 00:13:18,160
- It's okay.
- (SQUEAKS)

67
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,423

68

There's nothing to fear.

Right?

75
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:46,122
You were just a little scared,
weren't you?

76
00:13:46,359 --> 00:13:47,884
(LAUGHS)

77
00:13:50,863 --> 00:13:51,830
He's perfect.

78
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,295
Will you let me keep him, Lord Yupa?

79
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,332
Of course. Certainly.

80
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,560
(GIGGLES) Thank you!

81

82
00:14:01,407 --> 00:14:03,432

running from that Ohm.

85

So, how's your family, Nausicaa?

86
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,380
What's wrong?

87
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,516
It's...

90
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:28,294
So the jungle's poisons
are taking their toll.

91
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,458
Yes.

92
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,299
Father says it's the fate of all of us
who live near the jungle.

93
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:36,499
I'm sorry. I should have come sooner.

94
00:14:38,378 --> 00:14:41,177
No, I'm just glad you could come at all.

95
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:45,077
Lord Yupa, there's something
I want to show you

96
00:14:45,251 --> 00:14:46,844
when we get back to the valley.

97
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,612
I've created my own secret room.

98
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,979
- Oh.
- I haven't shown it to anyone yet

99
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,316
because I think it'll frighten them.

100
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,550
You get to be the first.

101
00:14:53,926 --> 00:14:56,486
I'll go on ahead and announce you.
See you there!

102

- LordYupa?
- Hmm?

103
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,258
Do you think you could
carry this back for me?

104
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,961
I'm afraid it's not
the easiest thing to fly with.

Why, Mito, you're looking fit!

Thank you, sir. I'm looking forward
to hearing all the news

121
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:45,333
from the other kingdoms tonight.

122
00:16:46,439 --> 00:16:47,998
Okay, start her up!

123
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,347
Nice work, Princess.

124
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,453
Thanks.

125
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:06,685
This is high-grade material, Lord Yupa.

126
00:17:07,059 --> 00:17:10,620
I'll send out a party to retrieve
the rest of the shell first thing tomorrow.

127
00:17:10,796 --> 00:17:13,356
- Come on. It's okay.
-Yes, ma'am.

128
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,430
LordYupa, we had a baby born
in the valley this year.

129
00:17:16,602 --> 00:17:18,570
Wonderful. Let's have a look.

130
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:22,271
Oh, she's a fine baby.
Strong and healthy.

131
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,409
She reminds me of Nausicai as a child.

132
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,547
We would be very honored
if you would choose a name for her.

133
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,512
With your blessing,
fair winds are sure to favor her.

134
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,346
Very well.

135
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,646
I'll see that she's given a good name.

136
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,413
Thank you, Lord Yupa.

137
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,082
May she grow up to be strong
just like Princess Nausicaa.

138
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,296
Hmph! It's good to hope for a
daughter who's strong like the Princess,

139
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,761
but not for one
who likes to play in the toxic jungle.

140
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,659
But, Mito, the jungle is where
I found the Ohm shell.

141
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:52,770
Alll do is worry
when she's running around out there.

142
00:17:53,139 --> 00:17:56,040
I'd trade 1,000 Ohm shells
for a good night's sleep.

143
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:59,508
(LAUGHS) Sorry, Mito.
We'd rather have the Ohm shells.

144
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,443
And I think the Princess should explore
all she wants.

145
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,811
I agree. Who else would
rescue me when I'm in trouble?

Mmm, things are grim.

I found two more kingdoms to the south
that have been consumed by the jungle.

it spreads faster every day.

Why can't the other kingdoms
live happily as you do here?

the wind from the sea

Soldiers of Tolmekia, hear me now.

358
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:33,605
Last night, the people of this valley
risked their lives

359
00:33:33,778 --> 00:33:35,746
attempting to prevent
your airship from crashing.

360
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:40,008
And just this morning, they finished
giving your dead a proper burial.

361
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,550
This may be a small kingdom,

362
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,711
but it clearly deserves
your courtesy and respect.

363
00:33:44,623 --> 00:33:47,320
If you are here to make war,
there must be a fitting reason,

364
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:49,551
and it's only right
to first send a messenger

365
00:33:49,728 --> 00:33:51,457
to announce your grievances.

If you fight now, the people
of the valley will be massacred.

So, you're Lord Yupa,

375
00:34:23,061 --> 00:34:25,723
I'm offended that you think
we need reprimanding.

come to massacre your people.

Villagers,

387
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,792
we have come to your land
in the name of peace.

388
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:33,461
Our goal is to unify the kingdoms
surrounding Tolmekia,

389
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:35,566
and build a world of prosperity.

390
00:35:35,734 --> 00:35:37,668
You now live at the edge of the jungle,

391
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,732
on the verge of extinction.

392
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:42,464
Follow us, and join our enterprise.

393
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:44,735
We shall put the toxic jungle
to the torch

394
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:47,708
- and resurrect this land together.
- MAN 1: Burn the toxic jungle?

MAN 2: With what?
MAN 3: Is that possible?

396
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:52,416
I have in my possession
mankind's greatest tool,

397
00:35:52,584 --> 00:35:55,246
the awesome force which
once allowed human beings

398
00:35:55,487 --> 00:35:56,545
to rule the Earth.

399
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,647
I guarantee that those who join me

400
00:35:59,824 --> 00:36:05,456
will live without fear of the insects
or the jungle's poisons ever again.

401
00:36:07,532 --> 00:36:10,160
OBABA: Stop! Stop, I say!

402
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:14,869
You must not touch the toxic jungle.

403
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,907
What are you babbling about, woman?

404
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,606
Guards, take her away.

405
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,541
No, let her speak.

406
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:25,808
Since the origin of the toxic jungle,
1,000 years ago,

407
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:29,415
people tried time and again to burn it.

408
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,717
But time and again, their attempts
did nothing but enrage the Ohm,

409
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,827
and swarms of them
spilled from the jungle

410
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,187
and stampeded across the lands.

411
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,573
They toppled cities,
destroyed kingdoms

412
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,733
and killed thousands.

413
00:36:52,911 --> 00:36:55,278
The Ohm could not be stopped.

414
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,504
Such rage did they feel,

415
00:36:57,682 --> 00:37:00,947
the Ohm fought till
they died of starvation.

416
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,516
Then spores took root in their corpses,

417
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,717
and the land soon
became part of the toxic jungle.

418
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,692
That's why you do not interfere with it.

419
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,798
Silence, you old hag.
We will have none of your raving.

420
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,766
You won't, will you? How will you shut
me up? Will you kill me, too?

421
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,271
Ah, silence, I said!

422
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:21,968
Go ahead and kill me!

423
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,469
It'll be easier for you
to kill an old, blind woman

424
00:37:25,643 --> 00:37:27,873
than it was for you
to murder our King Jihl!

Nice valley. I think we should keep it.

443
00:38:38,383 --> 00:38:39,680
I must object, Your Highness.

444
00:38:40,018 --> 00:38:43,818
Our orders are to transport the giant
warrior back to Tolmekia immediately.

445
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,313
Those orders cannot be carried out.

446

The giant warrior is so heavy,

447
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:50,424
even our largest ship
couldn't transport it.

448
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:52,687
Your Highness,
you can't seriously want to stay here

449
00:38:52,864 --> 00:38:53,831
and start a new kingdom?

450
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,061
Then what should I do?

451
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,993
You really think
I should deliver up that monster

452

for those fools back home?

Ah, yes, I do see your point.

I used soil drawn from there as well.

aren't poisonous.

I'd like to thank you for saving me.

We're actually beneath the toxic jungle.

- Beneath the jungle?
-Yeah.

737
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,322
See that?
We fell through that hole up there.

I couldn't believe it, either.

must die and fossilize,

Mmm. It's okay, though.

771
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,859
What's the origin of the jungle?

772
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:03,137
You sure spend a lot of time
thinking about strange things.

773
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,507
The trees of the toxic jungle
must have evolved

774
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:10,476
to purify the Earth of all the pollution
that we humans have made.

775
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:14,240
The trees absorb the pollution
so it becomes inert.

776
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,512
Then they die and petrify
and then crumble into purified sand.

777
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:21,680
That's how these underground
caverns must've been formed.

778
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,856
And the insects,
they evolved to guard this place.

779
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:29,688
If that's true, then mankind
is destined to go extinct.

780
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,392
It'll take centuries
for these trees to cleanse the Earth.

781
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:35,128
We can't survive with insects that long.

782
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,633
Somehow, we are going to
have to find a way

What? We are nothing like those
bloodthirsty Tolmekians.

786
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,884
We'd never use the warrior
as a weapon.

deep beneath the Earth after all.

to Her Highness?

802
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,941

her ship exploded in midair.

that their princess's ship went down?

So, is this lowly soldier
finally on the path to fame and fortune,

809
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,770
or on the path to destruction?

01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,379
LordYupa,
Mito and the others are back.

811
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,846
They're all waiting for you
at the Acid Lake.

812
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,855
Down there.

813
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,565
MITO: We shouldn't have returned
without the Princess.

814
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,074
LORDYUPA: No, I'm glad
that all of you are safe.

815
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:34,908
You're letting me go?

816
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,816
LORDYUPA:Yes, granted that you
drown the giant warrior in the Acid Lake

817
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:40,922
and then return to your kingdom.

818
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,320
You have very few soldiers
left in the valley.

819
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,324
We could easily defeat your forces now,

820
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,792
but I see no point in further killing.

821
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:50,058
The warrior can't be
drowned or destroyed,

822
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,596
and until it walks on its own,
it can't be moved.

823
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,669
Don't you understand? It's too late.

824
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,033
There's no turning back now.

825
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,002
I was ordered to attack Pejite
because we feared

826
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,038
another kingdom would
get a hold of the warrior's power.

827
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,814
Once its existence is known,

828
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:09,680
all the remaining kingdoms
will send their armies here to claim it.

829
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:14,048
You really only have
one choice, Lord Yupa.

830

831
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,459
Use it to repel the invading kingdoms

832
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,822
and learn to live with the monster.

01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:26,793
Hmm.

836
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,061

837
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,033
That's right, and whatever
lucky man becomes my husband

838
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,875
will see worse than that.

839
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,635
The insects must be stopped.

840
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,905
You must revive the warrior and use it
to destroy them and their jungle.

841
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,643
Steal it from us
as we stole it from Pejite.

842
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,751
That's what I'd do if I were you.

843
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,385

857

If we give them tools to burn the spores,
they could use them against us instead.

- Sir, the ship is ready.
-Try not to fail this time.

Assemble all the Tolmekian soldiers
left in Pejite

862

- and bring them to the valley.

the entire tree.

OBABA: This forest is doomed.

884

We must burn it down.

885
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:39,533
If we hesitate, the toxic jungle
will engulf the entire valley.

886

Isn't there some other way?

887
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:46,241
This forest has protected the valley
from the jungle's poisons for 300 years.

If only the Tolmekians had never come.

889

It looks like
things are getting out of control.

890

Everything looks the same to me.

been destroyed.

Pejite is finished.

906
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,098
It was far too much to pay, even if it
did get the Tolmekians out of our city.

907
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,167
"Too much to pay"?

01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,041

What have you done to our city?
It's completely destroyed!

913
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,962
Don't worry. We can rebuild it.

914
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,362
And if the jungle starts to spread here,
we'll burn it off.

915

With what? The giant warrior isn't here.

916
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:04,329
We know. It's in the Valley of the Wind.

920

will be dead...

Asbel, who is this?

924
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,121
She's the princess
of the Valley of the Wind,

925
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:25,454

Asbel, you know what the plan is.
You have to tell me.

929
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,503

into the valley.

01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:44,304

out of the hands of the Tolmekians,

no matter what it takes.

936

We're doing this for the good
of the planet. You've got to understand.

937

You're killing my people!

It's too late.

940
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:10,235
Once the insects start stampeding,
they can't be stopped.

941
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:15,504
The Tolmekians nearly
killed off all our people.

942
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:17,107
They must be stopped.

943
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:19,880
We have no other choice.

Ah! Let me go!

948
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,389
Things may seem
bad to you now, Princess,

949
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,330
but once we have the warrior, we'll burn
the jungle, and take back the Earth.

950
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,334
You savages!
You're just as bad as the Tolmekians!

951
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,405
You're wrong. The Tolmekians
want to take over the world.

952
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,407
Listen, every one of us
relies on water from the wells,

953
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:51,478
because mankind has polluted
all the lakes and rivers.

954
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,440
But do you know why
the well water is pure?

955
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:55,811
The trees of the wasteland purify it.

956
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,509
And you plan to burn the trees down?

957
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,150
You must not burn down
the toxic jungle!

958
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,552
You should have left the giant warrior
beneath the Earth!

959
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,554
So what should we do?

960
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,952
Surrender and become
the slaves of the Tolmekians?

961
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,425
Don't you understand?

962
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,429
Asbel, tell them how the jungle evolved,

963
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,933
and how the insects are guarding it
so we won't pollute the world again.

alive from the middle of the jungle.

loves these beat-up old hands of mine.

1134

she knows these
are the hands of a hard worker.

How can you be so foolish?
The jungle is killing you,

yet you want to live in harmony with it?

1137

You plan to burn down the jungle,

1138

only in small amounts.

1139

That's right.
Too much fire gives birth to nothing.
