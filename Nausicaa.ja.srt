1
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,040
また村が一つ死んだ

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,620
行こう

3
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,100
ここも時期腐海に沈む

4
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,862
オームの道

5
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,395
まだ新しい

6
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,947
オームの抜け殻！

7
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,362
すごい

8
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,363
完全な抜け殻なんて初めて

9
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,441
いい音

10
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,586
セラミック刀が欠けちゃった

11
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,330
谷の人が喜ぶわ

12
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,897
道具作りの材料にずっと
困らなくて済むもの

13
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,169
すごい目

14
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,102
これ一つなら
持って飛べるかな

15
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,630
あぁ　取れた！

16
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,533
わぁ　なんて軽いんだろ

17
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,785
ムシゴ椰子が午後の胞子を飛ばしている

18
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,805
綺麗

19
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,439
マスクをしなければ

20
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,484
五分で肺が腐ってしまう死の森なのに

21
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,539
誰

22
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,914
何かしら

23
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,383
胸がドキドキする

24
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:12,457
虫封じの銃が！

25
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,019
誰かが虫に襲われてる！

26
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,830
あっ　ごめん！

27
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,747
あそこだ

28
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,045
すごい胞子の煙

29
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,023
オーム！

30
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,920
きっとあの抜け殻の主だわ

31
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,531
あっちに逃げては駄目だ

32
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,502
気がついて

33
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,970
答えた！こっちへ来る

34
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,070
あの人は

35
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,566
なんて立派なオーム

36
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,666
- ？？？
- すまん！

37
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,303
オーム　森へお帰り

38
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,581
この先はお前の世界じゃないのよ

39
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,450
ね、いい子だから

40
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,386
怒りに我忘れてる

41
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,518
鎮めなきゃ

42
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,651
閃光でオームが目を回した

43
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,924
虫笛

44
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,891
オーム　目を醒まして

45
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,061
森へ帰ろう

46
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,214
気がついたわ

47
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,194
オームが森へ帰ってゆく

48
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,968
光玉と虫笛だけでオームを
鎮めてしまうとは

49
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,109
ユパ様！

50
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:38,485
ナウシカ　見間違えたぞ

51
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,057
一年半振りですもの！
父が喜びます

52
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,820
礼を言わねばならん

53
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,087
良い風使いになったな

54
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,833
いいえ　父がまだまだだって

55
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,399
うん、そうそう。こいつの事
すっかり忘れておった

56
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,742
ま！狐栗鼠！
私初めて

57
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,445
こいつが羽虫に攫われたのを
人の子と間違えてな

58
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,680
つい銃を使ってしまったのだ

59
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,648
それであんなにオームが怒ったのね

60
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,488
気絶しておったので

61
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,286
毒を吸わなかった様だ

62
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,752
いや、手は出さん方がいい。
ちびでも凶暴だ

63
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,218
おいで

64
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,660
さ

65
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,423
おっ　おい

66
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,132
ほら　怖くない

67
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,836
怖くない

68
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,233
ほらね　怖くない

69
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,213
ね？

70
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,522
怯えていただけなんだよね

71
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:51,830
ユパ様

72
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,395
この子私に下さいな

73
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,332
おお　構わんが

74
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,560
わぁ　ありがとう！

75
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,263
パイにクイ　私覚えてる？

76
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,432
不思議な力だ

77
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,344
疲れたでしょう、いっぱい走って

78
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,476
皆に変わりはないかな

79
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,380
どうした

80
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,516
父が

81
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,293
父はもう飛べません

82
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,453
ジルが？

83
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,994
森の毒がもうそんなに

84
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,458
はい

85
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,299
腐海の・に生きる者の定めとか

86
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,299
もっと早くに訪れるべきであった

87
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,377
いいえ　本当によく来て下さいました

88
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,577
先生　後で是非見て頂きたい物があるんです

89
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,912
私の秘密の部屋

90
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,679
- ほ
- みんなには内緒！

91
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,016
怖がるといけないから

92
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,950
私先に知らせに行きます

93
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:56,286
先生も急いで！

94
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,264
ユパ様？

95
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,258
これ運んで下さる？

96
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,961
気流が乱れてうまく飛べないの

97
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,282
それにしてもよく風を読む

98
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,042
さっ　もう少しだ

99
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,920
- おぉユパ様！
- ようこそ！

100
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,922
ほぉ　皆も息災か

101
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,493
水も風も滞りなく穏やかです

102
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,658
ユパ様！

103
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,601
あぁ　みんな元気だね

104
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,954
姫様　お着きになりましたぞ

105
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,193
もうちょっと

106
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,052
ユパ様！

107
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,996
ミトオジ、性が出るな

108
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,397
今宵はまた異国の話を聞かして下さい！

109
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,398
いいわ　回して

110
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,347
いい様ですな

111
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,453
うん

112
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,085
おぉ　本当に良い品じゃ

113
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,620
さすが明日にでも人手を繰り出して
取りに行かねばな

114
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,356
- さ、トヨト
- ええ

115
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,630
ユパ様　今年生まれたトヨトの子です

116
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,570
おぉ　どれどれ

117
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,671
ほほ　良い子だ

118
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,409
幼い頃のナウシカを思い出す

119
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,747
どうかこの子の名付け親に
なって下さいませ

120
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,512
いつもいい風がその子に
吹きます様に

121
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,346
引き受けよう

122
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,646
良い名を贈らせてもらうよ

123
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,413
ありがとう

124
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,082
どうか姫様の様に
丈夫に育ちます様に

125
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,296
うん　丈夫というなら
姫様は折り紙付きじゃ

126
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,961
だが腐海遊びまで似ると困るぞ

127
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,659
でもおかげでオームの殻を見つけたのよ

128
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,470
しかしだ　城オジの儂の身になってみろ

129
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,040
心配で・しておれんわい

130
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,608
オームの殻となりゃ

131
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,443
姫様の腐海遊びも無駄とは言えんのぉ

132
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,811
そうとも　儂もそれで助けられたのだからな

133
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:41,419
会うた子に助けられたか

134
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,415
この谷がいい

135
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,653
いつ来ても心が和む

136
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,624
今度の旅はどうじゃった

137
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,360
ん　酷いものだ

138
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,998
南でまた二つの国が
腐海に飲まれてしまった

139
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,132
腐海が着実に広がっている

140
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,865
なのにどこへ行っても
戦に植え

141
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,800
不吉な陰ばかりだ

142
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,410
なぜの谷の様に暮らせぬのか

143
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,842
ここは海から吹く風様に

144
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,475
守られておるからの

145
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,222
腐海の毒も谷へは届かぬ

146
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,316
どうだユパ

147
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,616
そろそろこの谷に腰を据えぬか

148
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,394
儂はこの様だ
皆も喜ぶが

149
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,429
んん

150
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,265
無駄じゃよ

151
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:33,499
ユパは探し続けるよう定められた男じゃ

152
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,568
定めか

153
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,404
大婆様　探すって何？

154
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:43,512
おや　ナウシカは知らなかったのかい

155
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:47,218
ほれ　あの壁の端にあるじゃろ

156
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,948
儂にはもう見えぬが

157
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:53,356
左の隅にいるお方じゃよ

158
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:59,162
その者、青き衣を纏いて

159
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,228
金色の野に降り立つべし

160
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:06,832
失われし大地との絆を結び

161
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:11,871
遂に人々を青き清浄な地に導かん

162
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,369
ユパ様　私古い言い伝えだと
ばかり思ってました

163
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,242
婆様　からかわれては困る

164
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,078
同じ事じゃろうが

165
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,653
私はただ

166
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,918
腐海の謎を解きたいと
願っているだけだよ

167
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,787
我々人間はこのまま腐海に飲まれて

168
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:34,159
滅びるよう定められた種族なのか

169
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,200
それを見極めたいのだ

170
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:53,580
私にユパ様のお手伝いが
できればいいのに

171
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,771
姫様　姫様

172
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,707
何　ミト

173
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,276
ゴルが風が臭うと言うとります

174
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,346
もうすぐ夜明けね
すぐ行くわ

175
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:29,880
ご苦労さん

176
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,023
いい嵐なんじゃが

177
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,026
どうもおかしい

178
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,345
あそこ！

179
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,145
ほら　また

180
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:01,853
船だわ

181
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,319
なぜこの様な辺境に船が…

182
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,483
何事かね

183
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,754
ユパ様　船です

184
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,828
- 船？
- 来るわ！

185
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,026
大きい！

186
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,508
トルメキアの大型船だ

187
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,678
飛び方がおかしい

188
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,779
不時着しようとしている

189
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,681
- ゴル、上げて
- え？

190
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,786
姫様　無茶じゃ！

191
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,456
海岸に誘導する

192
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,588
回ってきたぞ

193
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,829
えぃ　行きますぞ！

194
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,199
テト

195
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,061
なんて事

196
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,289
腐海に降りて虫を殺したんだわ

197
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,094
舵を引けぇ！ぶつかるぞぉ！

198
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,563
舵を引けぇ

199
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,673
舵を！

200
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,853
- 落ちた
- 姫様

201
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,593
右側の崖だ

202
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,961
行こう！

203
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,853
あの子だわ　生きてる

204
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,074
ここは…

205
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,481
風の谷よ　喋っては駄目

206
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,997
私は

207
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,235
ペジテのラステル

208
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,868
積荷を　積荷を燃やして

209
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,936
積荷？

210
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,974
お願い　燃やして

211
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,941
積荷ね　わかった

212
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,012
大丈夫　みんな燃えたわ

213
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,842
よかった

214
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,051
姫様！

215
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,721
この方はペジテ市の王族の姫君ですな

216
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,079
虫だ！ウシヤブが生きてるぞ！

217
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,114
まずい　仲間を呼んでる

218
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,050
傷付いて飛べないんだ

219
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:58,181
- 銃を持って来い！
- 駄目だ！打てば・中間を呼ぶぞ！

220
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,786
即死させる

221
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,721
ウシヤブは銃で死ぬもんか！

222
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,321
じゃあどうするんだ

223
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,194
待って

224
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,733
- ミト　メーベを持ってきて
- はい

225
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,257
姫様！

226
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,781
森へお帰り

227
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:28,381
大丈夫　飛べるわ

228
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,993
そう　いい子ね

229
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:42,928
- 姫様
- ありがとう

230
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,124
よかったぁ

231
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,885
たった一匹殺しただけでも

232
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,689
何が起こるかわかりませんからな

233
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,716
オーム

234
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,172
あった！来て！

235
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,816
こっち

236
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:17,185
やっぱりあの船に胞子が
くっ付いてたんだね

237
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,621
まだ毒は出してないな

238
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,127
もう一踏ん張りだ

239
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,356
うん　一つでも残すと
大変だからね

240
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,408
何だろうこの塊は

241
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,108
あの炎でも燃えないとはなぁ

242
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,141
ああみんな
こいつの詮索は後回しだ

243
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,350
胞子を焼く手伝いに行ってくれ

244
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,277
念入りに頼むぞ！

245
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,915
全く厄介な物を持ち込みおって

246
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,159
ミト　ここを見ろ

247
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,192
ああ？

248
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,029
動いとる

249
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:03,929
まるで生きとる様だ

250
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,337
ユパ様　これは…

251
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,802
旅の途中で不吉な噂を聞いた

252
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,440
ペジタ市の地下に眠っていた
旧世界の怪物が

253
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,143
掘り出されたと言うのだ

254
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,475
旧世界の怪物？

255
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,214
巨神兵だ

256
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,375
巨神兵

257
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,420
あの「火の七日間」で
世界を焼き尽くしたという…

258
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,450
こいつが

259
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,357
巨神兵は全て化石となったはずだった

260
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,307
だが地下で千年も
眠り続けていたやつがいたのだ

261
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:50,136
そういえば　こいつが人の形にも見えます

262
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,914
トルメキアは遥か西方の
凶暴な軍事国家

263
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,521
死んだペジテの虜囚といい、気になる

264
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,191
後お願い

265
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,203
何かしら

266
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,328
トルメキアの船だ！

267
00:31:40,728 --> 00:31:41,728
みんなは城へ！

268
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,906
みんな　城へぇ！

269
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,172
みんな　城へ集まれぇ！

270
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,609
城へ！

271
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,644
父上！

272
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,896
婆様は隠れておれ！

273
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,661
私はここに居るよ

274
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,347
姫様！？

275
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:48,760
おのれ！

276
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:13,925
ナウシカ

277
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,454
双方動くな

278
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,358
動けばオームの皮より削り出した

279
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:26,368
この剣がセラミック装甲も貫くぞ

280
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,438
あの男　ユパです

281
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,765
トルメキア兵に訊く

282
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,105
この民の者は

283
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,746
昨夜そなた達の船を救わんと
必死に働いた

284
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:40,008
今もまた死者を丁重に葬ったばかりだ

285
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,550
小なりとはいえ

286
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,911
その国に対するこれが
トルメキアの礼儀か

287
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:48,720
戦を仕掛けるならば
それなりの理由があるはず

288
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,551
まず使者を立て
口上を述べるべきであろう

289
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:56,759
ナウシカ

290
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,359
落ち着けナウシカ

291
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,533
今戦えば谷の者が皆殺しになろう

292
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,067
生き延びて機会を待つのだ

293
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:08,167
くそぉ

294
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,673
この娘が！

295
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,610
止めろクロトワ

296
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,210
しかし…

297
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:19,422
なんてやつだよ
みんな殺しちまいやがった

298
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,686
諫言耳が痛い

299
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,723
辺境一の剣士
ユパ・ビラルダとはそなたの事か

300
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:29,426
我らが目的が殺戮ではない

301
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,626
話がしたい

302
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:32,226
剣を収められよ

303
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,408
姫様だ

304
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:19,847
聞け！

305
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,220
トルメキア帝国辺境派遣の司令官

306
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,480
クシャナ殿下のお言葉だ

307
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,182
我らは

308
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,792
辺境の国々を統合し

309
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,461
この地に王道楽土を建設するために来た

310
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:37,668
そなた達は腐海のために滅びに貧している

311
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,732
我らに従い

312
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,864
我が事業に参加せよ

313
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,735
腐海を焼き払い

314
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:46,235
再びこの大地を蘇らすのだ！

315
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:47,608
腐海を焼き払うだと？

316
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,210
そんな事できるのか

317
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,316
かつて人間をして

318
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:56,046
この大地の主となした
奇跡の技と力を我らは復活させた

319
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,347
私に従う者には

320
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:02,456
もはや森の毒や虫どもに
怯えぬ暮らしを約束しよう

321
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,660
待ちなされ！

322
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,669
腐海に手を出してはならぬ

323
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,907
なんだ　この婆

324
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,606
おい　連れて行け

325
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,541
言わせてやれ

326
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:24,108
腐海が生まれてより千年

327
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:28,815
幾度も人は腐海を焼こうと試みてきた

328
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:33,317
が　その度にオームの群れが怒りに狂い

329
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:38,327
地を埋め尽くす大波となって
押し寄せてきた

330
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,573
国を滅ぼし
町を飲み込み

331
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,333
自らの命が餓鬼で果てるまで

332
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:57,278
オームは走り続けた

333
00:36:58,078 --> 00:37:01,478
軈てオームの骸を苗床にして

334
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:04,478
胞子が大地に根を張り

335
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,717
広大な土地が腐海に没したのじゃ

336
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,692
腐海に手を出してはならん

337
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,798
黙れ！その様な世迷い言許さんぞ

338
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,366
おや　どうするんじゃ？

339
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:18,966
儂も殺すのか

340
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,271
貴様！

341
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,268
殺すがいい！

342
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,769
盲の年寄りさ
簡単なものだよ！

343
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,573
ジルを殺した様にね

344
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,570
ジル様？

345
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,388
黙らせろ！

346
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,988
逆らうやつは容赦するな

347
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,686
みんな待って！

348
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,686
私の話を聞いて

349
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,090
これ以上犠牲を出したくないの

350
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,733
お願い

351
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,305
姫様

352
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,935
大婆様もわかって

353
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:00,435
この人達に従いましょう

354
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,409
なかなか良い谷ではないか

355
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,680
私は反対です

356
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:43,818
本国では一刻も早く
巨神兵を運べと命令しています

357
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,313
命令は実行不能だ

358
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,925
大型船すらあいつの重さに
耐えきれず

359
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:50,225
墜落してしまった

360
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:54,331
しかし　まさか本心でこの地に
国家を建設するなどと

361
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,061
だとしたらどうなのだ

362
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,993
お前はあの化物を

363
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,464
本国の馬鹿共の玩具にしろというのか

364
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,967
Ah, yes, I do see your point.

365
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,002
But I am just a soldier of Tolmekia.

366
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,606
lam not in a position
to make that decision.

367
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,904
Hmm. Weasel.

368
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,078
I'm reporting back to Pejite.

369
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:17,421
While I'm gone,
begin to awaken the warrior.

370
00:39:17,689 --> 00:39:18,656
Right.

371
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:20,324
KUSHANA:They have a gunship?

374
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,455
I'll leave for Pejite
first thing in the morning.

375
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,365
But, Kushana, why must
the Princess go with you?

376
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:34,665
Aren't five hostages,
food and the gunship enough?

377
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:37,365
Select your five hostages
and load up the cargo barge

378
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:38,703
before tomorrow's departure.

Mito, thank you
for accompanying the Princess.

383
00:39:52,957 --> 00:39:55,858
No, I'm glad to go.
But look at those greedy Tolmekians.

384

They're stripping us of everything.

Don't worry about that.

386
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:01,024
Our only concern is that
the warrior stay dormant.

387
00:40:01,833 --> 00:40:04,461
I'm going to leave the valley, then I'll
slip back and wait for my chance.

Nausicai, what are you doing here?

396
00:41:26,884 --> 00:41:29,444
This chamber is filled with toxic plants.

397
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:33,083
I collected the spores
and grew them down here myself.

398
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,453
Don't worry.
The plants aren't poisonous.

399
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,552
They're not poisonous?

400
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:42,028
(SNIFFS) It's true.
The air is pure in here.

401
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:46,195
But I know these plants from the jungle.
These are some of the most lethal.

402
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:49,162
l irrigated this chamber using water

403
00:41:49,540 --> 00:41:52,202
drawn from deep underground
by the castle windmill.

404
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:56,072
I used soil drawn from there as well.

405
00:41:56,881 --> 00:41:58,872
I found that, with clean water and soil,

406
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,111
the plants from the toxic jungle
aren't poisonous.

407
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,220
All the poison is in the soil.

408
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:07,058
Even the topsoil in our valley
is polluted.

409
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:13,491
But I don't understand
who could've polluted the entire Earth.

410
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,065
You discovered this all on your own?

411
00:42:16,667 --> 00:42:20,934
Yes. I was hoping to find
a cure for Father's illness.

I've already cut off the water.

415
00:42:30,581 --> 00:42:33,278

Then they die and petrify

And the insects,
they evolved to guard this place.

If that's true, then mankind
is destined to go extinct.

720
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,770
or on the path to destruction?

721
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,379
LordYupa,
Mito and the others are back.

722
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,846
They're all waiting for you
at the Acid Lake.

723
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,855
Down there.

724
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,565
MITO: We shouldn't have returned
without the Princess.

725
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,074
LORDYUPA: No, I'm glad
that all of you are safe.

726
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:34,908
You're letting me go?

727
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,816
LORDYUPA:Yes, granted that you
drown the giant warrior in the Acid Lake

728
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:40,922
and then return to your kingdom.

729
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,320
You have very few soldiers
left in the valley.

730
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,324
We could easily defeat your forces now,

731
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,792
but I see no point in further killing.

732
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:50,058
The warrior can't be
drowned or destroyed,

733
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,596
and until it walks on its own,
it can't be moved.

734
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,669
Don't you understand? It's too late.

735
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,033
There's no turning back now.

736
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,002
I was ordered to attack Pejite
because we feared

737
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,038
another kingdom would
get a hold of the warrior's power.

738
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,814
Once its existence is known,

739
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:09,680
all the remaining kingdoms
will send their armies here to claim it.

740
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:14,048
You really only have
one choice, Lord Yupa.

741
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,349
Revive the giant warrior.

742
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,459
Use it to repel the invading kingdoms

743
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,822
and learn to live with the monster.

744
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:21,964
Look.

01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,497
(GASPING)

746
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:26,793
Hmm.

747
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,061
An insect did that?

748
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,033
That's right, and whatever
lucky man becomes my husband

749
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,875
will see worse than that.

750
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,635
The insects must be stopped.

751
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,905
You must revive the warrior and use it
to destroy them and their jungle.

752
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,643
Steal it from us
as we stole it from Pejite.

753
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,751
That's what I'd do if I were you.

754
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,385
No, we will keep the warrior dormant
as it was meant to be.

755

-Valley!
- Okay.

- Some of the spores survived!
-What? In the valley?

760
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,166
They're spreading poison everywhere.
The whole valley's in a panic.

- MAN 1: Before it's too late!

766

If we don't do something fast,
the whole valley will be destroyed.

767
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:21,890
Hurry, the spores are spreading fast.

768
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:25,790
If we give them tools to burn the spores,
they could use them against us instead.

769
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,829
We have no choice.
Hand over everything but their guns.

770

Yes, sir.

01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:32,933
- Sir, the ship is ready.
-Try not to fail this time.

772
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,434
Assemble all the Tolmekian soldiers
left in Pejite

773
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:36,901
- and bring them to the valley.
-Yes, sir.

774
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,564
What a mess.

775
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,900

Good luck finding the Princess.

We must burn it down.

796
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:39,533
If we hesitate, the toxic jungle
will engulf the entire valley.

797

Isn't there some other way?

798
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:46,241
This forest has protected the valley
from the jungle's poisons for 300 years.

If only the Tolmekians had never come.

things are getting out of control.

Pejite is finished.

817
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,098
It was far too much to pay, even if it
did get the Tolmekians out of our city.

818

"Too much to pay"?

Don't worry. We can rebuild it.

825
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,362
And if the jungle starts to spread here,
we'll burn it off.

With what? The giant warrior isn't here.

827
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:04,329
We know. It's in the Valley of the Wind.

What are you planning to do

Asbel, who is this?

01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,121
She's the princess

Once the insects start stampeding,
they can't be stopped.

Things may seem
bad to you now, Princess,

860
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,330
but once we have the warrior, we'll burn
the jungle, and take back the Earth.

861
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,334
You savages!
You're just as bad as the Tolmekians!

862
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,405
You're wrong. The Tolmekians
want to take over the world.

863
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,407
Listen, every one of us
relies on water from the wells,

864
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:51,478
because mankind has polluted
all the lakes and rivers.

865
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,440
But do you know why
the well water is pure?

866
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:55,811
The trees of the wasteland purify it.

867
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,509
And you plan to burn the trees down?

868
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,150
You must not burn down
the toxic jungle!

869
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,552
You should have left the giant warrior
beneath the Earth!

870
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,554
So what should we do?

871
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,952
Surrender and become
the slaves of the Tolmekians?

01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,429
Asbel, tell them how the jungle evolved,

874

so we won't pollute the world again.

Just rescue the soldiers with the tanks.

890
01:22:23,705 --> 01:22:24,570
-Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

891
01:22:24,940 --> 01:22:26,533
Sir, the villagers just killed
our last soldier on the field.

892
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:29,507
- Are they heading for the castle?
- Not yet.

893
01:22:29,678 --> 01:22:31,544
But more of them keep gathering.

894
01:22:31,713 --> 01:22:35,547
All this over a little forest.
They're as annoying as the Pejites.

895
01:22:35,717 --> 01:22:37,242
If they just calmed down...

896
01:22:41,423 --> 01:22:42,652
Look out!

897
01:22:43,025 --> 01:22:43,958
Huh?

(SCREAMING)

899
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,394
They hijacked our tank.

- I'm going. Don't rush me.

Come on, come on. Let's go.

904
01:23:02,077 --> 01:23:03,567
Maybe it's this one.

905
01:23:05,481 --> 01:23:06,573
Hey, it's doing something.

906
01:23:06,748 --> 01:23:08,682

914
01:23:34,776 --> 01:23:36,540
She's alive.

915
01:23:36,712 --> 01:23:38,737
That dream didn't last long.

Your Highness!

917
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:46,979
We'll hold off the troops.

918
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:50,284
You round up the villagers
and seek shelter by the Acid Lake.

919
01:23:50,459 --> 01:23:52,587
- Right. Let's go!
- Come on!

920
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:56,629
We just have to lie low until

01:24:03,472 --> 01:24:05,133
Don't just stand there. Give me a hand.

924
01:24:05,374 --> 01:24:06,603
But I have a bad back.

It's a ship from Pejite.

933
01:24:35,704 --> 01:24:36,671
I caught a glimpse
just beyond the clouds.

934

-The princess?

1022

They expect her to come back here
and rescue them with their gunship.

1023
01:31:34,956 --> 01:31:36,822
That gunship could be
areal pain in the neck.

1024
01:31:36,992 --> 01:31:38,790
Should we start a fight now
and avoid the mess?

1025

Do you know anything
about that old ship they're hiding in?

before the Seven Days of Fire.

I don't know if it's true,

1028
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,034
but it's supposed to have traveled
everywhere, even to the stars.

1029
01:31:48,203 --> 01:31:50,831
They say guns can't
penetrate its armor,

1030
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,872
but I bet if you hit it just right...

1031
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:54,566
No, we're going to wait for the Princess.

1032
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:55,935
What?

1033
01:31:56,111 --> 01:32:00,173
I want to see if she can make it back
alive from the middle of the jungle.

1034
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:04,075
If she's not dead, I'd like a chance
to get to know her.

1035
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:09,848
So, men, have you
made up your minds yet?

1036
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:13,188
If you advise the villagers
to surrender, I'll let you go.

1037
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:15,987
Or would you rather end up like Pejite?

1038
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,858
It's strange that you're a princess, too.

1039
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,902
You're not anything at all
like our princess.

1040
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:24,867
Ah, take a look at my hands.

1041
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,770
I have the same illness as King Jihl.

1042
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:31,776
Six months from now,
my hands will be as hard as rocks.

1043
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:36,975
But our princess told me that she truly
loves these beat-up old hands of mine.

1044
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,576
When she looks at these hands,

1045
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:41,845
she knows these
are the hands of a hard worker.

1046
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:45,057
How can you be so foolish?
The jungle is killing you,

1047
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,853
yet you want to live in harmony with it?

1048
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:49,222
You plan to burn down the jungle,

1049
01:32:49,597 --> 01:32:52,225
but we've learned to use fire
only in small amounts.

1050
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,797
That's right.
Too much fire gives birth to nothing.

1051
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,996
Fire can reduce a forest
to ashes in a day,

1052
01:32:59,174 --> 01:33:02,940
while it takes the water and the wind
100 years to grow one anew.

1053
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:05,808
We prefer the ways
of the water and the wind.

1054
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:10,144
The Princess will be devastated
when she sees that our forest is gone.

1055
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:14,014
Sir. Do we have any orders yet, sir?

1056
01:33:14,189 --> 01:33:16,157
- Just shut up.
-Yes, sir.

1057
