1
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,040
また村が一つ死んだ

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,620
行こう

3
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,100
ここも時期腐海に沈む

4
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,862
オームの道

5
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,395
まだ新しい

6
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,947
オームの抜け殻！

7
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,362
すごい

8
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,363
完全な抜け殻なんて初めて

9
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,441
いい音

10
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,586
セラミック刀が欠けちゃった

11
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,330
谷の人が喜ぶわ

12
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,897
道具作りの材料にずっと
困らなくて済むもの

13
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,169
すごい目

14
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,102
これ一つなら
持って飛べるかな

15
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,630
あぁ　取れた！

16
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,533
わぁ　なんて軽いんだろ

17
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,785
ムシゴ椰子が午後の胞子を飛ばしている

18
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,805
綺麗

19
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,439
マスクをしなければ

20
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,484
五分で肺が腐ってしまう死の森なのに

21
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,539
誰

22
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,914
何かしら

23
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,383
胸がドキドキする

24
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:12,457
虫封じの銃が！

25
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,019
誰かが虫に襲われてる！

26
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,830
あっ　ごめん！

27
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,747
あそこだ

28
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,045
すごい胞子の煙

29
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,023
オーム！

30
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,920
きっとあの抜け殻の主だわ

31
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,531
あっちに逃げては駄目だ

32
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,502
気がついて

33
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,970
答えた！こっちへ来る

34
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,070
あの人は

35
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,566
なんて立派なオーム

36
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,666
- ？？？
- すまん！

37
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,303
オーム　森へお帰り

38
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,581
この先はお前の世界じゃないのよ

39
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,450
ね、いい子だから

40
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,386
怒りに我忘れてる

41
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,518
鎮めなきゃ

42
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,651
閃光でオームが目を回した

43
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,924
虫笛

44
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,891
オーム　目を醒まして

45
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,061
森へ帰ろう

46
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,214
気がついたわ

47
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,194
オームが森へ帰ってゆく

48
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,968
光玉と虫笛だけでオームを
鎮めてしまうとは

49
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,109
ユパ様！

50
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:38,485
ナウシカ　見間違えたぞ

51
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,057
一年半振りですもの！
父が喜びます

52
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,820
礼を言わねばならん

53
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,087
良い風使いになったな

54
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,833
いいえ　父がまだまだだって

55
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,399
うん、そうそう。こいつの事
すっかり忘れておった

56
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,742
ま！狐栗鼠！
私初めて

57
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,445
こいつが羽虫に攫われたのを
人の子と間違えてな

58
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,680
つい銃を使ってしまったのだ

59
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,648
それであんなにオームが怒ったのね

60
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,488
気絶しておったので

61
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,286
毒を吸わなかった様だ

62
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,752
いや、手は出さん方がいい。
ちびでも凶暴だ

63
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,218
おいで

64
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,660
さ

65
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,423
おっ　おい

66
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,132
ほら　怖くない

67
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,836
怖くない

68
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,233
ほらね　怖くない

69
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,213
ね？

70
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,522
怯えていただけなんだよね

71
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:51,830
ユパ様

72
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,395
この子私に下さいな

73
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,332
おお　構わんが

74
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,560
わぁ　ありがとう！

75
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,263
パイにクイ　私覚えてる？

76
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,432
不思議な力だ

77
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,344
疲れたでしょう、いっぱい走って

78
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,476
皆に変わりはないかな

79
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,380
どうした

80
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,516
父が

81
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,293
父はもう飛べません

82
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,453
ジルが？

83
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,994
森の毒がもうそんなに

84
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,458
はい

85
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,299
腐海の・に生きる者の定めとか

86
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,299
もっと早くに訪れるべきであった

87
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,377
いいえ　本当によく来て下さいました

88
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,577
先生　後で是非見て頂きたい物があるんです

89
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,912
私の秘密の部屋

90
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,679
- ほ
- みんなには内緒！

91
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,016
怖がるといけないから

92
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,950
私先に知らせに行きます

93
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:56,286
先生も急いで！

94
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,264
ユパ様？

95
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,258
これ運んで下さる？

96
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,961
気流が乱れてうまく飛べないの

97
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,282
それにしてもよく風を読む

98
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,042
さっ　もう少しだ

99
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,920
- おぉユパ様！
- ようこそ！

100
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,922
ほぉ　皆も息災か

101
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,493
水も風も滞りなく穏やかです

102
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,658
ユパ様！

103
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,601
あぁ　みんな元気だね

104
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,954
姫様　お着きになりましたぞ

105
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,193
もうちょっと

106
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,052
ユパ様！

107
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,996
ミトオジ、性が出るな

108
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,397
今宵はまた異国の話を聞かして下さい！

109
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,398
いいわ　回して

110
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,347
いい様ですな

111
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,453
うん

112
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,085
おぉ　本当に良い品じゃ

113
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,620
さすが明日にでも人手を繰り出して
取りに行かねばな

114
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,356
- さ、トヨト
- ええ

115
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,630
ユパ様　今年生まれたトヨトの子です

116
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,570
おぉ　どれどれ

117
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,671
ほほ　良い子だ

118
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,409
幼い頃のナウシカを思い出す

119
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,747
どうかこの子の名付け親に
なって下さいませ

120
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,512
いつもいい風がその子に
吹きます様に

121
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,346
引き受けよう

122
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,646
良い名を贈らせてもらうよ

123
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,413
ありがとう

124
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,082
どうか姫様の様に
丈夫に育ちます様に

125
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,296
うん　丈夫というなら
姫様は折り紙付きじゃ

126
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,961
だが腐海遊びまで似ると困るぞ

127
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,659
でもおかげでオームの殻を見つけたのよ

128
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,470
しかしだ　城オジの儂の身になってみろ

129
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,040
心配で・しておれんわい

130
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,608
オームの殻となりゃ

131
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,443
姫様の腐海遊びも無駄とは言えんのぉ

132
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,811
そうとも　儂もそれで助けられたのだからな

133
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:41,419
会うた子に助けられたか

134
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,415
この谷がいい

135
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,653
いつ来ても心が和む

136
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,624
今度の旅はどうじゃった

137
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,360
ん　酷いものだ

138
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,998
南でまた二つの国が
腐海に飲まれてしまった

139
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,132
腐海が着実に広がっている

140
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,865
なのにどこへ行っても
戦に植え

141
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,800
不吉な陰ばかりだ

142
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,410
なぜの谷の様に暮らせぬのか

143
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,842
ここは海から吹く風様に

144
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,475
守られておるからの

145
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,222
腐海の毒も谷へは届かぬ

146
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,316
どうだユパ

147
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,616
そろそろこの谷に腰を据えぬか

148
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,394
儂はこの様だ
皆も喜ぶが

149
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,429
んん

150
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,265
無駄じゃよ

151
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:33,499
ユパは探し続けるよう定められた男じゃ

152
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,568
定めか

153
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,404
大婆様　探すって何？

154
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:43,512
おや　ナウシカは知らなかったのかい

155
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:47,218
ほれ　あの壁の端にあるじゃろ

156
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,948
儂にはもう見えぬが

157
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:53,356
左の隅にいるお方じゃよ

158
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:59,162
その者、青き衣を纏いて

159
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,228
金色の野に降り立つべし

160
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:06,832
失われし大地との絆を結び

161
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:11,871
遂に人々を青き清浄な地に導かん

162
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,369
ユパ様　私古い言い伝えだと
ばかり思ってました

163
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,242
婆様　からかわれては困る

164
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,078
同じ事じゃろうが

165
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,653
私はただ

166
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,918
腐海の謎を解きたいと
願っているだけだよ

167
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,787
我々人間はこのまま腐海に飲まれて

168
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:34,159
滅びるよう定められた種族なのか

169
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,200
それを見極めたいのだ

170
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:53,580
私にユパ様のお手伝いが
できればいいのに

171
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,771
姫様　姫様

172
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,707
何　ミト

173
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,276
ゴルが風が臭うと言うとります

174
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,346
もうすぐ夜明けね
すぐ行くわ

175
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:29,880
ご苦労さん

176
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,023
いい嵐なんじゃが

177
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,026
どうも可笑しい

178
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,345
あそこ！

179
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,145
ほら　また

180
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:01,853
船だわ

181
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,319
なぜこの様な辺境に船が…

182
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,483
何事かね

183
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,754
ユパ様　船です

184
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,828
- 船？
- 来るわ！

185
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,026
大きい！

186
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,508
トルメキアの大型船だ

187
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,678
飛び方がおかしい

188
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,779
不時着しようとしている

189
00:22:32,952 --> 00:22:34,681
- ゴル　上げて
- え？

190
00:22:35,454 --> 00:22:36,786
姫様　無茶じゃ！

191
00:22:36,956 --> 00:22:38,456
海岸に誘導する

192
00:22:42,227 --> 00:22:43,588
回ってきたぞ

193
00:22:43,562 --> 00:22:45,829
えぃ　行きますぞ！

194
00:22:46,465 --> 00:22:47,199
テト

195
00:23:15,961 --> 00:23:17,061
なんて事

196
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:19,289
腐海に降りて虫を殺したんだわ

197
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:24,094
舵を引けぇ！ぶつかるぞぉ！

198
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,563
舵を引けぇ

199
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:31,673
舵を！

200
00:23:46,158 --> 00:23:47,853
- 落ちた
- 姫様

201
00:23:48,027 --> 00:23:49,593
海際の崖だ

202
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:50,961
行こう！

203
00:24:19,959 --> 00:24:21,853
あの子だわ　生きてる

204
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:43,074
ここは…

205
00:24:42,948 --> 00:24:44,481
風の谷よ　喋っては駄目

206
00:24:59,598 --> 00:25:00,997
私は

207
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:04,235
ペジテのラステル

208
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:07,868
積荷を　積荷を燃やして

209
00:25:07,639 --> 00:25:08,936
積荷？

210
00:25:09,108 --> 00:25:10,974
お願い　燃やして

211
00:25:11,143 --> 00:25:12,941
積荷ね　わかった

212
00:25:13,112 --> 00:25:15,012
大丈夫　みんな燃えたわ

213
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:18,842
よかった

214
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:20,051
姫様！

215
00:25:30,362 --> 00:25:33,721
この方はペジテ市の王族の姫君ですな

216
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,079
虫だ！ウシヤブが生きてるぞ！

217
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:53,114
まずい　仲間を呼んでる

218
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,050
傷付いて飛べないんだ

219
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:58,181
- 銃を持って来い！
- 駄目だ！打てば・中間を呼ぶぞ！

220
00:25:58,557 --> 00:25:59,786
即死させる

221
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:01,721
ウシヤブは銃で死ぬもんか！

222
00:26:01,821 --> 00:26:03,321
じゃあどうするんだ

223
00:26:03,295 --> 00:26:04,194
待って

224
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:06,733
- ミト　メーヴェを持ってきて
- はい

225
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:09,257
姫様！

226
00:26:25,584 --> 00:26:26,781
森へお帰り

227
00:26:26,881 --> 00:26:28,381
大丈夫　飛べるわ

228
00:26:37,529 --> 00:26:38,993
そう　いい子ね

229
00:26:41,332 --> 00:26:42,928
- 姫様
- ありがとう

230
00:27:06,191 --> 00:27:07,124
よかったぁ

231
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,885
たった一匹殺しただけでも

232
00:27:09,061 --> 00:27:11,689
何が起こるかわかりませんからな

233
00:28:09,021 --> 00:28:10,716
オーム

234
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:11,172
あった！来て！

235
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,816
こっち

236
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:17,185
やっぱりあの船に胞子が
くっ付いてたんだね

237
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:18,621
まだ毒は出してないな

238
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:25,127
もう一踏ん張りだ

239
00:29:25,297 --> 00:29:27,356
うん　一つでも残すと
大変だからね

240
00:29:35,474 --> 00:29:37,408
何だろうこの塊は

241
00:29:37,676 --> 00:29:40,108
あの炎でも燃えないとはなぁ

242
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:43,141
ああみんな
こいつの詮索は後回しだ

243
00:29:43,315 --> 00:29:45,350
胞子を焼く手伝いに行ってくれ

244
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:49,277
念入りに頼むぞ！

245
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:52,915
全く厄介な物を持ち込みおって

246
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:55,159
ミト　ここを見ろ

247
00:29:55,327 --> 00:29:56,192
ああ？

248
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,029
動いとる

249
00:30:02,229 --> 00:30:03,929
まるで生きとる様だ

250
00:30:05,437 --> 00:30:07,337
ユパ様　これは…

251
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:10,802
旅の途中で不吉な噂を聞いた

252
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:14,440
ペジタ市の地下に眠っていた
旧世界の怪物が

253
00:30:14,712 --> 00:30:16,143
掘り出されたと言うのだ

254
00:30:16,881 --> 00:30:18,475
旧世界の怪物？

255
00:30:19,017 --> 00:30:20,214
巨神兵だ

256
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:21,375
巨神兵

257
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,420
あの「火の七日間」で
世界を焼き尽くしたという…

258
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:27,450
こいつが

259
00:30:33,932 --> 00:30:37,357
巨神兵は全て化石となったはずだった

260
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:45,307
だが地下で千年も
眠り続けていたやつがいたのだ

261
00:30:46,777 --> 00:30:50,136
そういえば　こいつが人の形にも見えます

262
00:30:51,216 --> 00:30:54,914
トルメキアは遥か西方の
凶暴な軍事国家

263
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:58,521
死んだペジテの虜囚といい、気になる

264
00:31:02,427 --> 00:31:04,191
後お願い

265
00:31:14,940 --> 00:31:16,203
何かしら

266
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:40,328
トルメキアの船だ！

267
00:31:40,728 --> 00:31:41,728
みんなは城へ！

268
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:51,906
みんな　城へぇ！

269
00:31:52,177 --> 00:31:54,172
みんな　城へ集まれぇ！

270
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:55,609
城へ！

271
00:31:57,449 --> 00:31:58,644
父上！

272
00:32:09,261 --> 00:32:11,896
婆様は隠れておれ！

273
00:32:12,164 --> 00:32:13,661
私はここに居るよ

274
00:32:32,050 --> 00:32:33,347
姫様！？

275
00:32:47,866 --> 00:32:48,760
おのれ！

276
00:33:12,757 --> 00:33:13,925
ナウシカ

277
00:33:19,364 --> 00:33:20,454
双方動くな

278
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,358
動けばオームの皮より削り出した

279
00:33:23,535 --> 00:33:26,368
この剣がセラミック装甲も貫くぞ

280
00:33:26,938 --> 00:33:28,438
あの男　ユパです

281
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,765
トルメキア兵に訊く

282
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,105
この民の者は

283
00:33:32,478 --> 00:33:35,746
昨夜そなた達の船を救わんと
必死に働いた

284
00:33:36,515 --> 00:33:40,008
今もまた死者を丁重に葬ったばかりだ

285
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:41,550
小なりとはいえ

286
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:44,911
その国に対するこれが
トルメキアの礼儀か

287
00:33:44,923 --> 00:33:48,720
戦を仕掛けるならば
それなりの理由があるはず

288
00:33:48,792 --> 00:33:51,551
まず使者を立て
口上を述べるべきであろう

289
00:33:55,934 --> 00:33:56,759
ナウシカ

290
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,359
落ち着けナウシカ

291
00:33:59,404 --> 00:34:02,533
今戦えば谷の者が皆殺しになろう

292
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,067
生き延びて機会を待つのだ

293
00:34:07,367 --> 00:34:08,167
くそぉ

294
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:09,673
この娘が！

295
00:34:10,048 --> 00:34:11,610
止めろクロトワ

296
00:34:12,010 --> 00:34:13,210
しかし…

297
00:34:15,619 --> 00:34:19,422
なんてやつだよ
みんな殺しちまいやがった

298
00:34:20,058 --> 00:34:21,686
諫言耳が痛い

299
00:34:22,761 --> 00:34:25,723
辺境一の剣士
ユパ・ビラルダとはそなたの事か

300
00:34:27,364 --> 00:34:29,426
我らが目的が殺戮ではない

301
00:34:29,526 --> 00:34:30,626
話がしたい

302
00:34:30,926 --> 00:34:32,226
剣を収められよ

303
00:35:11,576 --> 00:35:13,408
姫様だ

304
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:19,847
聞け！

305
00:35:20,519 --> 00:35:23,220
トルメキア帝国辺境派遣の司令官

306
00:35:23,455 --> 00:35:25,480
クシャナ殿下のお言葉だ

307
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,182
我らは

308
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,792
辺境の国々を統合し

309
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:33,461
この地に王道楽土を建設するために来た

310
00:35:34,634 --> 00:35:37,668
そなた達は腐海のために滅びに貧している

311
00:35:38,503 --> 00:35:39,732
我らに従い

312
00:35:39,904 --> 00:35:41,864
我が事業に参加せよ

313
00:35:42,641 --> 00:35:43,735
腐海を焼き払い

314
00:35:43,835 --> 00:35:46,235
再びこの大地を蘇らすのだ！

315
00:35:46,509 --> 00:35:47,608
腐海を焼き払うだと？

316
00:35:47,679 --> 00:35:49,210
そんな事できるのか

317
00:35:49,481 --> 00:35:51,316
かつて人間をして

318
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:56,046
この大地の主となした
奇跡の技と力を我らは復活させた

319
00:35:56,855 --> 00:35:58,347
私に従う者には

320
00:35:58,724 --> 00:36:02,456
もはや森の毒や虫どもに
怯えぬ暮らしを約束しよう

321
00:36:07,232 --> 00:36:08,660
待ちなされ！

322
00:36:12,537 --> 00:36:15,669
腐海に手を出してはならぬ

323
00:36:15,673 --> 00:36:16,907
なんだ　この婆

324
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,606
おい　連れて行け

325
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:20,541
言わせてやれ

326
00:36:21,246 --> 00:36:24,108
腐海が生まれてより千年

327
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:28,815
幾度も人は腐海を焼こうと試みてきた

328
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:33,317
が　その度にオームの群れが怒りに狂い

329
00:36:33,592 --> 00:36:38,327
地を埋め尽くす大波となって
押し寄せてきた

330
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,573
国を滅ぼし
町を飲み込み

331
00:36:50,942 --> 00:36:54,333
自らの命が飢餓で果てるまで

332
00:36:54,511 --> 00:36:57,278
オームは走り続けた

333
00:36:58,078 --> 00:37:01,478
軈てオームの骸を苗床にして

334
00:37:01,778 --> 00:37:04,478
胞子が大地に根を張り

335
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,717
広大な土地が腐海に没したのじゃ

336
00:37:08,993 --> 00:37:11,692
腐海に手を出してはならん

337
00:37:11,863 --> 00:37:14,798
黙れ！その様な世迷い言許さんぞ

338
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,366
おや　どうするんじゃ？

339
00:37:16,866 --> 00:37:18,966
儂も殺すのか

340
00:37:19,304 --> 00:37:20,271
貴様！

341
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,268
殺すがいい！

342
00:37:22,340 --> 00:37:25,769
盲の年寄りさ
簡単なものだよ！

343
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,573
ジルを殺した様にね

344
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,570
ジル様？

345
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,388
黙らせろ！

346
00:37:37,688 --> 00:37:38,988
逆らうやつは容赦するな

347
00:37:39,557 --> 00:37:40,686
みんな待って！

348
00:37:40,986 --> 00:37:42,686
私の話を聞いて

349
00:37:46,698 --> 00:37:49,090
これ以上犠牲を出したくないの

350
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:51,733
お願い

351
00:37:53,338 --> 00:37:54,305
姫様

352
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,935
大婆様もわかって

353
00:37:58,435 --> 00:38:00,435
この人達に従いましょう

354
00:38:36,314 --> 00:38:38,409
なかなか良い谷ではないか

355
00:38:38,583 --> 00:38:39,680
私は反対です

356
00:38:40,218 --> 00:38:43,818
本国では一刻も早く
巨神兵を運べと命令しています

357
00:38:44,322 --> 00:38:46,313
命令は実行不能だ

358
00:38:46,491 --> 00:38:48,925
大型船すらあいつの重さに
耐えきれず

359
00:38:49,025 --> 00:38:50,225
墜落してしまった

360
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:54,331
しかし　まさか本心でこの地に
国家を建設するなどと

361
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,061
だとしたらどうなのだ

362
00:38:56,734 --> 00:38:57,993
お前はあの化物を

363
00:38:58,069 --> 00:39:00,464
本国の馬鹿共の玩具にしろというのか

364
00:39:00,805 --> 00:39:02,967
そりゃまあ　分かりますよね

365
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,002
私は一軍人に過ぎません

366
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,606
その様な判断は分を超えます

367
00:39:07,879 --> 00:39:09,904
フン　狸め

368
00:39:13,951 --> 00:39:15,478
私はペジテに戻る

369
00:39:15,553 --> 00:39:17,921
留守中、巨神兵の復活に全力を注げ

370
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:18,656
はっ

371
00:39:19,457 --> 00:39:21,124
このガンシップは使えるのか

372
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,761
はい　拾いもんです

373
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,889
間違えるな

374
00:39:26,464 --> 00:39:28,455
私は相談しているのではない

375
00:39:29,033 --> 00:39:31,365
しかし姫様をペジテへ連れて行くなど…

376
00:39:31,836 --> 00:39:34,565
人質五人にガンシップで食料とは…

377
00:39:34,839 --> 00:39:36,265
人選は任せる

378
00:39:36,465 --> 00:39:38,665
明朝の出発までに準備を完了しろ

379
00:39:51,155 --> 00:39:52,387
人質ご苦労

380
00:39:52,757 --> 00:39:54,558
儂らともかく　見て下さい

381
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:56,994
やつら何もかも持って
行っちまうつもりですぜ

382
00:39:57,862 --> 00:39:59,652
儂は一度この地を離れ

383
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,924
密かに戻って機会を待つ

384
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:05,124
何としてもあの化物の復活を
止めさせねばならん

385
00:40:05,202 --> 00:40:05,669
はい

386
00:40:09,907 --> 00:40:10,797
ナウシカ

387
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:28,389
テト　お前の主はどこに居るのだ

388
00:41:23,748 --> 00:41:26,511
ナウシカ　これはどういう事だ

389
00:41:27,284 --> 00:41:29,444
腐海の植物ではないか

390
00:41:29,988 --> 00:41:33,083
私が胞子を集めて
育てたんです

391
00:41:33,257 --> 00:41:35,453
大丈夫　瘴気は出していません

392
00:41:36,027 --> 00:41:37,552
毒を出さん？

393
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:40,828
確かにここの空気が清浄だが

394
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:43,695
何故だ

395
00:41:43,795 --> 00:41:46,595
猛毒のヒソクサリが花を付けておるのに

396
00:41:47,171 --> 00:41:48,362
ここの水は

397
00:41:48,740 --> 00:41:52,202
城の大風車で地下五百メートルから
上げている水です

398
00:41:53,177 --> 00:41:56,072
砂は同じ井戸の底から集めました

399
00:41:56,981 --> 00:41:58,872
綺麗な水と土では

400
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:02,111
腐海の木々も毒を出さないと判った

401
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,220
汚れているのは土なんです

402
00:42:04,589 --> 00:42:07,058
この谷の土ですら汚れているんです

403
00:42:07,758 --> 00:42:08,658
なぜ？

404
00:42:09,593 --> 00:42:13,491
誰が世界をこんな風にして
しまったのでしょう

405
00:42:14,165 --> 00:42:16,065
そなたそれを自分で…

406
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,934
ええ　父やみんなの病気を治したくて

407
00:42:21,405 --> 00:42:22,205
でも

408
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:27,101
もうここも閉めます

409
00:42:28,046 --> 00:42:30,008
さっき水を止めたから

410
00:42:30,081 --> 00:42:32,078
軈てみんな枯れるでしょう

411
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:47,156
ナウシカ

412
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:50,301
私　自分が怖い

413
00:42:51,301 --> 00:42:54,535
憎しみに駆られて
何をするか分からない

414
00:42:55,305 --> 00:42:58,000
もう誰も殺したくないのに

415
00:43:28,940 --> 00:43:31,232
姫姉様！

416
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,138
これみんなで集めたの

417
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:36,713
- チコの実
- 姫姉様に上げます

418
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:39,977
みんな

419
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:42,480
こんなに沢山

420
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:46,180
大変だったろうに

421
00:43:46,657 --> 00:43:47,988
ありがとう

422
00:43:48,159 --> 00:43:49,593
大事に食べるからね

423
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,723
姫姉様可愛そう

424
00:43:51,695 --> 00:43:53,022
飛びを急げ！出発だ

425
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,324
みんなも泣かないで

426
00:43:58,136 --> 00:44:00,832
大丈夫よ
私はすぐ帰って来るわ

427
00:44:01,439 --> 00:44:02,297
本当に？

428
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,973
あら　私が嘘吐いた事あった？

429
00:44:06,144 --> 00:44:07,236
ない

430
00:44:07,611 --> 00:44:08,640
ね？

431
00:44:08,813 --> 00:44:09,746
うん

432
00:44:10,248 --> 00:44:11,215
本当ね？

433
00:44:13,184 --> 00:44:14,709
さ　危ないから

434
00:44:20,658 --> 00:44:22,092
きっとね！

435
00:44:33,337 --> 00:44:34,969
姫様を頼むぞぉ

436
00:45:27,158 --> 00:45:29,092
ペジテはまだかいな

437
00:45:29,260 --> 00:45:31,456
腰が痛くなっちまった

438
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:33,257
やれやれ

439
00:45:33,357 --> 00:45:36,757
姫様も惜しげのない者
ばかい良う選んだわい

440
00:45:38,169 --> 00:45:40,237
な　可笑しいと思わんか

441
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,037
なんでこんなに密集して飛ぶんじゃ

442
00:45:43,207 --> 00:45:44,072
うん

443
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:47,067
いや　まるで襲撃に怯えてる様だ

444
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:05,257
雲の下はすごい瘴気の渦だわ

445
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,334
動くな

446
00:46:20,277 --> 00:46:21,136
ガンシップ！

447
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,447
敵襲！二番艦がやられた！

448
00:46:41,065 --> 00:46:42,198
言った通りじゃ！

449
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,095
ぎゃあ　恐ろしい

450
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,532
?

451
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:52,042
ペジテのガンシップです！

452
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:52,842
ペジテ？

453
00:47:04,522 --> 00:47:07,184
くそぉ　三番艦も食われた！

454
00:47:07,258 --> 00:47:09,053
コルベットは何をしてるんだ！

455
00:47:10,226 --> 00:47:11,422
何ちゅう脆い船じゃ

456
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:22,435
He's hit the rear guard!

457
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:28,801
バージのワイヤーが！

458
00:47:34,952 --> 00:47:37,182
テト　早く

459
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,602
駄目じゃ　これも落ちる

460
00:47:57,675 --> 00:47:58,308
姫様！

461
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:07,049
止めて！もう殺さないで！

462
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:17,987
止めて！

463
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:38,605
姫様

464
00:48:47,324 --> 00:48:49,418
急いでミト！

465
00:48:49,593 --> 00:48:51,357
姫様　もう駄目じゃ！

466
00:48:57,368 --> 00:48:59,268
- 飛べるかもしれない
- 何ですと！？

467
00:49:01,338 --> 00:49:02,897
ミト　早く！

468
00:49:03,073 --> 00:49:04,370
はい！

469
00:49:05,342 --> 00:49:07,367
エンジン始動！
砲で扉を破る！

470
00:49:07,545 --> 00:49:08,478
はい！

471
00:49:16,587 --> 00:49:17,354
来い！

472
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:19,320
早く！

473
00:49:21,692 --> 00:49:22,723
早く中へ！

474
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:23,890
ミト　行ける？

475
00:49:24,190 --> 00:49:25,490
どうにか！

476
00:49:27,765 --> 00:49:30,029
発砲と同時にエンジン全開！

477
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:30,490
了解！

478
00:49:31,035 --> 00:49:31,603
用意

479
00:49:31,903 --> 00:49:32,603
射て！

480
00:49:44,315 --> 00:49:45,443
瘴気マスクを着けろ

481
00:49:45,543 --> 00:49:47,643
雲下に降りてバージを救出する！

482
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,364
温かい　死なないでテト

483
00:50:15,046 --> 00:50:16,578
何という世界だ

484
00:50:16,878 --> 00:50:18,878
こんな濃ゆい瘴気は初めてだ

485
00:50:19,650 --> 00:50:21,880
後席　右後方に注意

486
00:50:22,152 --> 00:50:23,216
近くに居る

487
00:50:24,322 --> 00:50:25,351
まだ飛んでる！

488
00:50:27,091 --> 00:50:28,558
あ　本当だ！

489
00:50:29,026 --> 00:50:29,953
本当に居た！

490
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:45,704
お　姫様じゃ！

491
00:50:46,076 --> 00:50:47,668
みんな　頑張って！

492
00:50:47,768 --> 00:50:49,268
今ロープを伸ばす

493
00:50:49,413 --> 00:50:53,077
フックが壊れとるじゃ
空中収用は無理じゃ

494
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,718
不時着して虫に食われるのは嫌じゃ！

495
00:50:56,787 --> 00:50:58,555
一思いに死にます！

496
00:50:58,922 --> 00:51:02,124
落ち着け！荷物を捨てるんじゃ！

497
00:51:02,593 --> 00:51:04,484
お元気で！

498
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:07,361
言う事を聞け！
荷物を捨てろ！

499
00:51:07,531 --> 00:51:09,222
後席　エンジンを切れ！

500
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,634
- 何と？
- エンジン音が邪魔だ。急げ！

501
00:51:11,802 --> 00:51:12,701
は　はい！

502
00:51:18,809 --> 00:51:20,703
姫様　何を

503
00:51:23,781 --> 00:51:25,643
姫様マスクを！

504
00:51:25,943 --> 00:51:27,043
死んじまう！

505
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,641
マスクをしなされ！

506
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,113
みんな　必ず助ける！

507
00:51:30,213 --> 00:51:32,313
私を信じて荷を捨てなさい！

508
00:51:32,356 --> 00:51:35,055
- 何でもしますから！
- 早くマスクを！

509
00:51:42,733 --> 00:51:44,201
姫様笑うとる

510
00:51:44,435 --> 00:51:45,869
助けるんじゃ

511
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,561
急げ！荷を捨てろ！

512
00:51:47,961 --> 00:51:49,161
・は落ちてる！

513
00:51:49,173 --> 00:51:51,574
エンジン点火！
不時着地を探す

514
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,807
あっ　少し肺に入った

515
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:14,149
姫様ぁ！

516
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:14,923
みんな無事？

517
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:16,858
動くな！

518
00:53:20,258 --> 00:53:21,258
貴様…

519
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:23,863
先程はご苦労

520
00:53:24,735 --> 00:53:26,863
姫様　なんでこんなやつを

521
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:28,663
甘いな

522
00:53:28,839 --> 00:53:31,536
私が這い蹲って
礼を言うとでも思ったのか

523
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,876
あなたは腐海を
何も分かっていない

524
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,380
ここは人間の世界じゃないわ

525
00:53:39,750 --> 00:53:43,251
銃を使うだけで
何が起こるか分からない所よ

526
00:53:44,522 --> 00:53:45,654
さっきの戦闘で

527
00:53:45,824 --> 00:53:48,715
船が沢山森に落ちて
虫達が怒っている

528
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,553
見なさい、上を

529
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,934
大王ヤンマは森の見張りよ

530
00:54:03,207 --> 00:54:05,503
すぐ他の虫を呼び集めるわ

531
00:54:05,876 --> 00:54:06,877
すぐ脱出する

532
00:54:06,977 --> 00:54:08,477
予備のロープを早く！

533
00:54:09,046 --> 00:54:10,310
ミト　フックを直して

534
00:54:10,381 --> 00:54:10,914
はい！

535
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:14,214
動くな！

536
00:54:14,414 --> 00:54:15,814
命令は私が下す

537
00:54:16,353 --> 00:54:18,087
あなたは何を怯えているの

538
00:54:18,187 --> 00:54:20,387
まるで迷子の狐栗鼠の様に

539
00:54:20,891 --> 00:54:21,883
何

540
00:54:22,659 --> 00:54:24,787
怖がらないで
私は只あなたに

541
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,287
自分の国へ帰ってもらいたいだけ

542
00:54:27,564 --> 00:54:28,866
貴様！

543
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:40,877
来た

544
00:54:54,892 --> 00:54:56,884
静かに！怒らせては駄目

545
00:54:58,462 --> 00:55:00,555
ここはオームの巣じゃ！

546
00:55:01,532 --> 00:55:02,824
囲まれたぁ

547
00:55:24,421 --> 00:55:26,153
私達を調べている

548
00:55:27,858 --> 00:55:30,021
オーム　ごめんなさい

549
00:55:30,495 --> 00:55:32,360
あなた達の巣を騒がして

550
00:55:33,597 --> 00:55:34,623
でも分かって

551
00:55:34,723 --> 00:55:36,623
私達あなた方の敵じゃないの

552
00:55:57,521 --> 00:55:59,221
姫様ぁ

553
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:10,319
あの人が生きてるの？

554
00:57:10,419 --> 00:57:12,219
待って　オーム！

555
00:57:26,677 --> 00:57:27,910
何が始まるんだ

556
00:57:28,078 --> 00:57:29,509
オームの目が真っ赤だ

557
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:41,589
姫様　メーヴェ等どうなさる気じゃ

558
00:57:41,959 --> 00:57:45,020
水が静まったらすぐ
離水して上空に対地！

559
00:57:45,362 --> 00:57:47,890
一時間して戻らなければ
谷に帰りなさい！

560
00:57:48,065 --> 00:57:49,430
えっ　しかし！

561
00:57:49,599 --> 00:57:50,727
姫様！

562
00:58:07,184 --> 00:58:09,581
行ってしまわれた…

563
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,087
渡してもらおう

564
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:17,457
さあ　みんな

565
00:58:17,757 --> 00:58:20,557
姫様の言われた通りにするんだ

566
00:58:23,266 --> 00:58:25,064
姫様

567
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:50,990
くっ　くそぉ

568
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,055
- 君は…
- あなたは殺しすぎる

569
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:31,793
もう光玉も虫笛も効かない

570
01:00:33,363 --> 01:00:34,888
流砂だ！

571
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,494
くそぉ

572
01:01:06,529 --> 01:01:08,529
もう二時間になるぞ

573
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,164
虫が増えるばかりじゃ

574
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:13,092
姫様ぁ

575
01:01:14,292 --> 01:01:16,892
姫様ぁ！

576
01:01:27,718 --> 01:01:29,118
ナウシカ

577
01:01:30,287 --> 01:01:32,119
ナウシカ！

578
01:01:34,356 --> 01:01:35,948
おいで

579
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:40,727
おいで！

580
01:01:42,699 --> 01:01:44,125
父さん

581
01:01:54,477 --> 01:01:56,172
母様も居る

582
01:02:05,021 --> 01:02:08,385
いや　私そっちに行きたくないの

583
01:02:10,327 --> 01:02:12,295
来ちゃ駄目！

584
01:02:15,732 --> 01:02:17,100
何も居ないわ

585
01:02:17,433 --> 01:02:18,967
何も居ないったら

586
01:02:24,507 --> 01:02:26,073
出て来ちゃ駄目

587
01:02:27,410 --> 01:02:29,003
オームの幼生です

588
01:02:29,179 --> 01:02:32,209
やはり虫に取り憑かれていたか

589
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:34,977
渡しなさい　ナウシカ

590
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:37,711
いや　何も悪い事してない

591
01:02:37,887 --> 01:02:42,382
虫と人とは同じ世界には
住めないのだよ

592
01:02:52,369 --> 01:02:55,464
お願い　殺さないで！

593
01:02:57,273 --> 01:02:58,668
お願い

594
01:03:17,260 --> 01:03:18,250
テト

595
01:04:20,023 --> 01:04:21,719
不思議な所

596
01:04:26,462 --> 01:04:27,229
や！

597
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,257
やっと見つけてきたよ

598
01:04:30,232 --> 01:04:31,566
気分はどう？

599
01:04:32,635 --> 01:04:33,598
ここはどこ？

600
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,498
まずお礼を言わせてくれ

601
01:04:36,873 --> 01:04:38,432
僕はペジテのアスベルだ

602
01:04:39,108 --> 01:04:40,872
助けてくれてありがとう

603
01:04:41,778 --> 01:04:44,513
私は風の谷のナウシカ

604
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:47,273
ここはどこ？

605
01:04:49,386 --> 01:04:50,854
驚くのは当たり前さ

606
01:04:51,320 --> 01:04:53,182
僕らは腐海の底に居るんだよ

607
01:04:53,556 --> 01:04:54,881
腐海の底？

608
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:57,322
ほら　あそこから落ちてきたんだよ

609
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,293
砂と一緒にね

610
01:05:01,497 --> 01:05:03,595
私達マスクをしてない

611
01:05:04,167 --> 01:05:04,900
そうなんだ

612
01:05:05,268 --> 01:05:07,200
ここの空気は澄んでいるんだよ

613
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:09,163
僕も驚いた

614
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,274
腐海の底にこんな所が
あるなんてね

615
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:20,376
どうした

616
01:05:31,561 --> 01:05:34,428
ナウシカ　あんまり遠く行くなよ

617
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,911
なんて立派な木

618
01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,030
枯れても水を通している

619
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:53,141
井戸の底の砂と同じ

620
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:05,084
石になった木が砕けて
降り積もっているんだわ

621
01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:24,773
ナウシカ

622
01:07:30,313 --> 01:07:31,437
泣いてるの

623
01:07:34,717 --> 01:07:36,544
うん　嬉しいの

624
01:07:56,739 --> 01:07:59,165
ラステルは僕の双子の妹なんだ

625
01:07:59,642 --> 01:08:01,804
側に居てやりたかった

626
01:08:02,478 --> 01:08:05,038
ごめんね　話すのが遅れて

627
01:08:05,214 --> 01:08:06,147
いや

628
01:08:07,083 --> 01:08:08,073
すまなかった

629
01:08:08,651 --> 01:08:10,345
妹を看取ってくれた人を

630
01:08:10,520 --> 01:08:12,318
僕は殺してしまう所だった

631
01:08:12,488 --> 01:08:13,319
ううん

632
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,558
そうか　あいつは風の谷にあるのか

633
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,164
不思議な味のする実だね

634
01:08:27,437 --> 01:08:30,469
チコの実というの
とても栄養があるのよ

635
01:08:42,685 --> 01:08:46,349
味はともかく長靴一杯食べたいよ

636
01:08:57,834 --> 01:08:59,859
腐海の生まれた訳か…

637
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:03,137
君は不思議な事を考える人だな

638
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:07,607
腐海の木々は人間が汚したこの世界を

639
01:09:07,707 --> 01:09:10,207
綺麗にするために生まれて来たの

640
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:13,840
大地の毒を体に取り込んで

641
01:09:13,884 --> 01:09:18,012
綺麗な結晶にしてから
死んで砂になっていくんだわ

642
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:21,680
この地下の空洞は
そうして出来たの

643
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,856
虫達はその森を守っている

644
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:29,688
だとしたら僕らは
滅びるしかなさそうだ

645
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,092
何千年掛かるか分からないのに

646
01:09:32,168 --> 01:09:34,728
瘴気や虫に怯えて
生きるのは無理だよ

647
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:40,633
せめて腐海をこれ以上
広げない方法が必要なんだ

648
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:44,138
あなたもクシャナと
同じ様に言うのね

649
01:09:44,313 --> 01:09:47,774
違う！僕らは巨神兵を戦争に
使う気なんかない

650
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:50,284
明日みんなに会えば分かるよ

651
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:52,153
もう寝ましょ

652
01:09:52,622 --> 01:09:55,587
明日沢山飛ばなきゃ…

653
01:10:19,549 --> 01:10:20,611
異常ありません！

654
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:25,484
現状は？

655
01:10:25,656 --> 01:10:27,584
上体はほぼ固まりました

656
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:55,909
全く　見れば見る程
可愛いバケモンだぜ　おめぇは

657
01:10:56,118 --> 01:10:58,349
貧乏軍人の俺ですら

658
01:10:58,421 --> 01:11:00,980
久しく錆びついてた野心が
うずいてくるぁ

659
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,886
笑ってやがる

660
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,395
てめぇなんざ　この世の終わりまで

661
01:11:09,495 --> 01:11:10,995
地下で眠ってりゃよかったんだい

662
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:12,860
参謀！

663
01:11:13,736 --> 01:11:16,235
殿下の編隊がペジテの残党に襲われ

664
01:11:16,805 --> 01:11:18,567
コルベット一艦を残して全滅しました

665
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:20,641
殿下はどうなされた？

666
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:23,641
艦は空中で四散したそうです

667
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:27,342
参謀！

668
01:11:29,018 --> 01:11:31,216
村の者にはまだ
気づかれていないな

669
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,855
- はい
- よし、すぐ行く

670
01:11:33,222 --> 01:11:34,956
他の者はこのまま
作業を続けろ

671
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:47,032
梲も上がらねぇ平民出に
やっと巡ってきた幸運か

672
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,770
それとも破滅の罠か

673
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:00,379
ミトじい達が戻って来たんだって

674
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,846
酸の海でユパ様を待ってます

675
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,565
儂らだけおめおめ戻って…

676
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,074
無事で何よりだった

677
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:34,908
釈放だと？

678
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,316
巨神兵を酸の海深く沈め

679
01:12:38,416 --> 01:12:40,416
本国へ帰ってくれぬか

680
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,320
谷に残る兵は少ない

681
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,324
今戦うは易しいが

682
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,792
これ以上の犠牲は無意味だ

683
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:50,058
やつには火も水も効かぬ

684
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,596
歩き出すまでは
最早動かす事もな

685
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,069
分からぬか

686
01:12:55,169 --> 01:12:57,169
最早後戻りはできないのだ

687
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,802
巨大な力を他国が持つ恐怖故に

688
01:13:00,902 --> 01:13:03,202
私はペジテ攻略を命令された

689
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,814
Once its existence is known,

690
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:09,680
all the remaining kingdoms
will send their armies here to claim it.

691
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:14,048
You really only have
one choice, Lord Yupa.

692
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,349
Revive the giant warrior.

693
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,459
Use it to repel the invading kingdoms

694
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,822
and learn to live with the monster.

695
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:21,964
Look.

696
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,497
(GASPING)

697
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:26,793
Hmm.

698
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,061
An insect did that?

699
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,033
That's right, and whatever
lucky man becomes my husband

700
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,875
will see worse than that.

701
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,635
The insects must be stopped.

702
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,905
You must revive the warrior and use it
to destroy them and their jungle.

703
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,643
Steal it from us
as we stole it from Pejite.

704
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,751
That's what I'd do if I were you.

705
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,385
No, we will keep the warrior dormant
as it was meant to be.

706
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:51,382
(GASPING) Lord Yupa!

707
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:53,986
- Emergency!
-You gotta give us the password.

708
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,961
-I'mina humy!
-Wind?

709
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:57,793
-Valley!
- Okay.

710
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,834
- Some of the spores survived!
-What? In the valley?

711
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,166
They're spreading poison everywhere.
The whole valley's in a panic.

712
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,474
(PANICKED MURMURING)

713
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,905
WOMAN: It's poison! See them?

714
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:11,808
(CLAMORING)

715
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,449
MAN 1: Please, don't be foolish!
MAN 2: We need to do something.

716
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,107
- MAN 3: Hurry!
- MAN 1: Before it's too late!

717
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,790
If we don't do something fast,
the whole valley will be destroyed.

718
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:21,890
Hurry, the spores are spreading fast.

719
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:25,790
If we give them tools to burn the spores,
they could use them against us instead.

720
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,829
We have no choice.
Hand over everything but their guns.

721
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:29,897
Yes, sir.

722
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:32,933
- Sir, the ship is ready.
-Try not to fail this time.

723
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,434
Assemble all the Tolmekian soldiers
left in Pejite

724
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:36,901
- and bring them to the valley.
-Yes, sir.

725
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,564
What a mess.

726
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,900
This is starting to look bad already.

727
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:43,068
(ALL SHOUTING) Come on! Hurry!

728
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,440
Let's go! Let's go!

729
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,181
Good luck finding the Princess.

730
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,179
Take care of the valley, and don't do
anything rash while we're gone.

731
01:14:51,554 --> 01:14:52,487
ALL: Yes, sir.

732
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,787
Come on. Let's get back to the valley.

733

Check it!

MAN: Oh, no!

737
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:14,909
We're too late.

738
01:15:15,077 --> 01:15:17,045
The spores have infested
the entire tree.

739
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:18,981
This one's infected, too!

740
01:15:19,582 --> 01:15:21,243
-WOMAN: This way!

We must burn it down.

747

If we hesitate, the toxic jungle
will engulf the entire valley.

748

Isn't there some other way?

749
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:46,241
This forest has protected the valley
from the jungle's poisons for 300 years.

things are getting out of control.

What's that haze over there?

Asbel, put your mask on!

Pejite is finished.

768
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,098
It was far too much to pay, even if it
did get the Tolmekians out of our city.

769
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,167
"Too much to pay"?

770

Asbel, what are you talking about?

771
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,041
An airship.

What have you done to our city?
It's completely destroyed!

775
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,962
Don't worry. We can rebuild it.

776
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,362
And if the jungle starts to spread here,
we'll burn it off.

777
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,170
With what? The giant warrior isn't here.

778
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:04,329

made plans to get it back.

will be dead...

What are you planning to do
to my valley?

785

Asbel, who is this?

786
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,121
She's the princess
of the Valley of the Wind,

787
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:25,454
and she saved my life.

Asbel, you know what the plan is.
You have to tell me.

791
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:39,503
We're going to bait insects
into the valley.

793
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:44,304

795
01:19:48,817 --> 01:19:51,479
What a monstrous thing to do.

796
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:55,223
We have to get the giant warrior
out of the hands of the Tolmekians,

797
01:19:55,391 --> 01:19:56,756
no matter what it takes.

798
01:19:56,925 --> 01:19:59,485
We're doing this for the good
of the planet. You've got to understand.

You're killing my people!

Please, please, stop this now!

It's too late.

802
01:20:07,436 --> 01:20:10,235
Once the insects start stampeding,
they can't be stopped.

803
01:20:13,342 --> 01:20:15,504
The Tolmekians nearly
killed off all our people.

804
01:20:15,878 --> 01:20:17,107
They must be stopped.

805
01:20:17,946 --> 01:20:19,880
We have no other choice.

Ah! Let me go!

810
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:36,389
Things may seem
bad to you now, Princess,

811
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,330
but once we have the warrior, we'll burn
the jungle, and take back the Earth.

812
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,334
You savages!
You're just as bad as the Tolmekians!

813
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,405
You're wrong. The Tolmekians
want to take over the world.

814
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,407
Listen, every one of us
relies on water from the wells,

815
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:51,478
because mankind has polluted
all the lakes and rivers.

816
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,440
But do you know why
the well water is pure?

817
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:55,811
The trees of the wasteland purify it.

818
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,509
And you plan to burn the trees down?

819
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,150
You must not burn down
the toxic jungle!

820
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,552
You should have left the giant warrior
beneath the Earth!

821
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,554
So what should we do?

822
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,952
Surrender and become
the slaves of the Tolmekians?

823
01:21:07,196 --> 01:21:08,425
Don't you understand?

824
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,429
Asbel, tell them how the jungle evolved,

825
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,933
and how the insects are guarding it
so we won't pollute the world again.

984
01:31:56,111 --> 01:32:00,173
I want to see if she can make it back
alive from the middle of the jungle.

985
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:04,075
If she's not dead, I'd like a chance

It's strange that you're a princess, too.

Six months from now,
my hands will be as hard as rocks.

loves these beat-up old hands of mine.

are the hands of a hard worker.

only in small amounts.
