1
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:25,040
また村が一つ死んだ

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:33,620
行こう

3
00:01:33,727 --> 00:01:36,100
ここも時期腐海に沈む

4
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:55,862
オームの道

5
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:05,395
まだ新しい

6
00:05:22,222 --> 00:05:23,947
オームの抜け殻！

7
00:05:35,769 --> 00:05:37,362
すごい

8
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:40,363
完全な抜け殻なんて初めて

9
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,441
いい音

10
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,586
ゼラニク刀が欠けちゃった

11
00:06:00,862 --> 00:06:02,330
谷の人が喜ぶわ

12
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:06,897
道具作りの材料にずっと
困らなくて済むもの

13
00:06:11,471 --> 00:06:13,169
すごい目

14
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:16,102
これ一つなら
持って飛べるかな

15
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:46,630
あぁ　取れた！

16
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,533
わぁ　なんて軽いんだろ

17
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:06,785
ムシゴ椰子が午後の胞子を飛ばしている

18
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:25,805
綺麗

19
00:07:27,179 --> 00:07:28,439
マスクをしなければ

20
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,484
五分で肺が腐ってしまう死の森なのに

21
00:07:52,805 --> 00:07:53,539
誰

22
00:08:02,582 --> 00:08:03,914
何かしら

23
00:08:06,785 --> 00:08:08,383
胸がドキドキする

24
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:12,457
虫封じの銃が！

25
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:14,019
誰かが虫に襲われてる！

26
00:08:20,766 --> 00:08:21,830
あっ　ごめん！

27
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:39,747
あそこだ

28
00:08:40,220 --> 00:08:42,045
すごい胞子の煙

29
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:45,023
オーム！

30
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,920
きっとあの抜け殻の主だわ

31
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:52,531
あっちに逃げては駄目だ

32
00:09:00,173 --> 00:09:01,502
気がついて

33
00:09:04,911 --> 00:09:06,970
答えた！こっちへ来る

34
00:09:40,046 --> 00:09:41,070
あの人は

35
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,566
なんて立派なオーム

36
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:09,666
- ？？？
- すまん！

37
00:10:12,312 --> 00:10:14,303
オーム　森へお帰り

38
00:10:14,681 --> 00:10:16,581
この先はお前の世界じゃないのよ

39
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,450
ね、いい子だから

40
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,386
怒りに我忘れてる

41
00:10:23,556 --> 00:10:24,518
鎮めなきゃ

42
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:57,651
閃光でオームが目を回した

43
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:00,924
虫笛

44
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:10,891
オーム　目を醒まして

45
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,061
森へ帰ろう

46
00:11:23,115 --> 00:11:24,214
気がついたわ

47
00:11:43,169 --> 00:11:45,194
オームが森へ帰ってゆく

48
00:11:46,171 --> 00:11:49,968
光玉と虫笛だけでオームを
鎮めてしまうとは

49
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,109
ユパ様！

50
00:12:36,688 --> 00:12:38,485
ナウシカ　見間違えたぞ

51
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:41,057
一年半振りですもの！
父が喜びます

52
00:12:41,227 --> 00:12:42,820
礼を言わねばならん

53
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:45,087
良い風使いになったな

54
00:12:45,265 --> 00:12:47,833
いいえ　父がまだまだだって

55
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:53,399
うん、そうそう。こいつの事
すっかり忘れておった

56
00:12:56,943 --> 00:12:59,742
ま！狐栗鼠！
私初めて

57
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:03,445
こいつが羽虫に攫われたのを
人の子と間違えてな

58
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:05,680
つい銃を使ってしまったのだ

59
00:13:05,851 --> 00:13:07,648
それであんなにオームが怒ったのね

60
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:09,488
気絶しておったので

61
00:13:09,555 --> 00:13:11,286
毒を吸わなかった様だ

62
00:13:11,658 --> 00:13:14,752
いや、手は出さん方がいい。
ちびでも凶暴だ

63
00:13:15,228 --> 00:13:16,218
おいで

64
00:13:16,696 --> 00:13:17,660
さ

65
00:13:18,331 --> 00:13:19,423
おっ　おい

66
00:13:21,934 --> 00:13:23,132
ほら　怖くない

67
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:25,836
怖くない

68
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:31,233
ほらね　怖くない

69
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:35,213
ね？

70
00:13:43,289 --> 00:13:45,522
怯えていただけなんだよね

71
00:13:50,963 --> 00:13:51,830
ユパ様

72
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:53,395
この子私に下さいな

73
00:13:53,466 --> 00:13:55,332
おお　構わんが

74
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:57,560
わぁ　ありがとう！

75
00:13:57,938 --> 00:14:00,263
パイにクイ　私覚えてる？

76
00:14:01,607 --> 00:14:03,432
不思議な力だ

77
00:14:04,744 --> 00:14:07,344
疲れたでしょう、いっぱい走って

78
00:14:11,417 --> 00:14:13,476
皆に変わりはないかな

79
00:14:16,356 --> 00:14:17,380
どうした

80
00:14:18,458 --> 00:14:19,516
父が

81
00:14:21,427 --> 00:14:23,293
父はもう飛べません

82
00:14:23,463 --> 00:14:24,453
ジルが？

83
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,994
森の毒がもうそんなに

84
00:14:28,468 --> 00:14:29,458
はい

85
00:14:29,635 --> 00:14:33,299
腐海の・に生きる者の定めとか

86
00:14:33,973 --> 00:14:37,299
もっと早くに訪れるべきであった

87
00:14:38,078 --> 00:14:42,377
いいえ　本当によく来て下さいました

88
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,577
先生　後で是非見て頂きたい物があるんです

89
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:48,912
私の秘密の部屋

90
00:14:48,988 --> 00:14:50,679
- ほ
- みんなには内緒！

91
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,016
怖がるといけないから

92
00:14:52,192 --> 00:14:53,950
私先に知らせに行きます

93
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:56,286
先生も急いで！

94
00:14:57,597 --> 00:14:59,264
ユパ様？

95
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:02,258
これ運んで下さる？

96
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:04,961
気流が乱れてうまく飛べないの

97
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,282
それにしてもよく風を読む

98
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:20,042
さっ　もう少しだ

99
00:15:56,088 --> 00:15:57,920
- おぉユパ様！
- ようこそ！

100
00:15:58,090 --> 00:15:59,922
ほぉ　皆も息災か

101
00:16:01,694 --> 00:16:04,493
水も風も滞りなく穏やかです

102
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:06,658
ユパ様！

103
00:16:06,933 --> 00:16:08,601
あぁ　みんな元気だね

104
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:34,954
姫様　お着きになりましたぞ

105
00:16:35,027 --> 00:16:36,193
もうちょっと

106
00:16:36,562 --> 00:16:38,052
ユパ様！

107
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,996
ミトオジ、性が出るな

108
00:16:41,367 --> 00:16:45,397
今宵はまた異国の話を聞かして下さい！

109
00:16:46,739 --> 00:16:48,398
いいわ　回して

110
00:16:59,118 --> 00:17:00,347
いい様ですな

111
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,453
うん

112
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:07,085
おぉ　本当に良い品じゃ

113
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:10,620
さすが明日にでも人手を繰り出して
取りに行かねばな

114
00:17:10,996 --> 00:17:13,356
- さ、トヨト
- ええ

115
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:16,630
ユパ様　今年生まれたトヨトの子です

116
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:18,570
おぉ　どれどれ

117
00:17:19,438 --> 00:17:21,671
ほほ　良い子だ

118
00:17:22,041 --> 00:17:24,409
幼い頃のナウシカを思い出す

119
00:17:24,577 --> 00:17:27,747
どうかこの子の名付け親に
なって下さいませ

120
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:30,512
いつもいい風がその子に
吹きます様に

121
00:17:31,117 --> 00:17:32,346
引き受けよう

122
00:17:32,518 --> 00:17:34,646
良い名を贈らせてもらうよ

123
00:17:35,420 --> 00:17:36,413
ありがとう

124
00:17:36,589 --> 00:17:40,082
どうか姫様の様に
丈夫に育ちます様に

125
00:17:40,393 --> 00:17:44,296
うん　丈夫というなら
姫様は折り紙付きじゃ

126
00:17:44,463 --> 00:17:46,961
だが腐海遊びまで似ると困るぞ

127
00:17:47,133 --> 00:17:49,659
でもおかげでオームの殻を見つけたのよ

128
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,470
しかしだ　城オジの儂の身になってみろ

129
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,040
心配で・しておれんわい

130
00:17:57,208 --> 00:17:58,608
オームの殻となりゃ

131
00:17:58,779 --> 00:18:01,443
姫様の腐海遊びも無駄とは言えんのぉ

132
00:18:01,614 --> 00:18:04,811
そうとも　儂もそれで助けられたのだからな

133
00:18:38,616 --> 00:18:41,419
会うた子に助けられたか

134
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:43,415
この谷がいい

135
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:45,653
いつ来ても心が和む

136
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,624
今度の旅はどうじゃった

137
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:51,360
ん　酷いものだ

138
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,998
南でまた二つの国が
腐海に飲まれてしまった

139
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:58,132
腐海が着実に広がっている

140
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,865
なのにどこへ行っても
戦に植え

141
00:19:01,941 --> 00:19:03,800
不吉な陰ばかりだ

142
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,410
なぜの谷の様に暮らせぬのか

143
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:10,842
ここは海から吹く風様に

144
00:19:10,915 --> 00:19:12,475
守られておるからの

145
00:19:12,652 --> 00:19:16,222
腐海の毒も谷へは届かぬ

146
00:19:16,388 --> 00:19:17,316
どうだユパ

147
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,616
そろそろこの谷に腰を据えぬか

148
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:25,394
儂はこの様だ
皆も喜ぶが

149
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:26,429
んん

150
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:28,265
無駄じゃよ

151
00:19:28,835 --> 00:19:33,499
ユパは探し続けるよう定められた男じゃ

152
00:19:34,907 --> 00:19:36,568
定めか

153
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,404
お婆様　探すって何？

154
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:43,512
おや　ナウシカは知らなかったのかい

155
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:47,218
ほれ　あの壁の端にあるじゃろ

156
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,948
儂にはもう見えぬが

157
00:19:50,124 --> 00:19:53,356
左の隅にいるお方じゃよ

158
00:19:55,128 --> 00:19:59,162
その者、青き衣を纏いて

159
00:19:59,331 --> 00:20:02,228
金色の野に降り立つべし

160
00:20:02,602 --> 00:20:06,832
失われし大地との絆を結び

161
00:20:07,606 --> 00:20:11,871
遂に人々を青き清浄な地に導かん

162
00:20:12,578 --> 00:20:16,369
ユパ様　私古い言い伝えだと
ばかり思ってました

163
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:19,242
婆様　からかわれては困る

164
00:20:19,719 --> 00:20:22,078
同じ事じゃろうが

165
00:20:22,654 --> 00:20:23,653
私はただ

166
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,918
腐海の謎を解きたいと
願っているだけだよ

167
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,787
我々人間はこのまま腐海に飲まれて

168
00:20:30,864 --> 00:20:34,159
滅びるよう定められた種族なのか

169
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:36,200
それを見極めたいのだ

170
00:20:49,882 --> 00:20:53,580
私にユパ様のお手伝いが
できればいいのに

171
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,771
姫様　姫様

172
00:21:14,273 --> 00:21:15,707
何　ミト

173
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,276
ゴルが風が臭うと言うとります

174
00:21:19,378 --> 00:21:21,346
もうすぐ夜明けね
すぐ行くわ

175
00:21:29,054 --> 00:21:29,880
ご苦労さん

176
00:21:30,555 --> 00:21:32,023
いい嵐なんじゃが

177
00:21:32,391 --> 00:21:34,026
どうもおかしい

178
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,345
あそこ！

179
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:55,145
ほら　また

180
00:22:00,886 --> 00:22:01,853
船だわ

181
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:04,319
なぜこの様な辺境に船が…

182
00:22:06,225 --> 00:22:07,483
何事かね

183
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:08,754
ユパ様　船です

184
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:10,828
- 船？
- 来るわ！

185
00:22:17,136 --> 00:22:18,026
大きい！

186
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:29,508
トルメキアの大型船だ

187
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:30,678
飛び方がおかしい

188
00:22:31,550 --> 00:22:32,779
不時着しようとしている

But time and again, their attempts
did nothing but enrage the Ohm,

350
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,827
and swarms of them
spilled from the jungle

351
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,187
and stampeded across the lands.

352
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,573

destroyed kingdoms

353
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,733
and killed thousands.

00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,504

they died of starvation.

357
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,516
Then spores took root in their corpses,

358
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,717
and the land soon
became part of the toxic jungle.

359
00:37:08,893 --> 00:37:11,692

01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:14,240
The trees absorb the pollution
so it becomes inert.

717
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,512
Then they die and petrify
and then crumble into purified sand.

718
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:21,680
That's how these underground
caverns must've been formed.

719
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,856
And the insects,
they evolved to guard this place.

720
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:29,688
If that's true, then mankind
is destined to go extinct.

721
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,392
It'll take centuries
for these trees to cleanse the Earth.

722
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:35,128
We can't survive with insects that long.

723
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,633
Somehow, we are going to
have to find a way

724
01:09:38,808 --> 01:09:40,606
to stop this toxic jungle from spreading.

725
01:09:41,210 --> 01:09:43,838
You Pejites sound
just like the Tolmekians.

726
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:47,774
What? We are nothing like those
bloodthirsty Tolmekians.

727
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,884
We'd never use the warrior
as a weapon.

728
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:52,753
Let's get some sleep, Asbel.

729
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:56,187
We'll need our strength
to make it to Pejite tomorrow.

730
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:19,470
(PULSING)

731
01:10:19,649 --> 01:10:21,811
MAN: All is well, sir.
KUROTOWA: Fine, fine.

732
01:10:23,986 --> 01:10:26,284
- Everything going smoothly?
-Yes, sir.

733
01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,684
The warrior's torso is almost developed.

734
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:55,709
I swear, the more I gaze at you,
the more attractive you get.

735
01:10:56,018 --> 01:10:58,749
You're awakening
long-forgotten ambitions,

736
01:10:58,921 --> 01:11:00,980
even in a lazy old soldier like me.

737
01:11:04,861 --> 01:11:06,886
Oh, is that a smile?

738
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,995
Perhaps you should remain buried
deep beneath the Earth after all.

739
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,260
- Sir!
- Mmm.

740
01:11:13,436 --> 01:11:16,235
Her Highness's fleet was attacked
by a survivor from Pejite.

741
01:11:16,405 --> 01:11:18,567
All but one of her ships were destroyed.

742
01:11:18,741 --> 01:11:20,641
KUROTOWA: What happened
to Her Highness?

743
01:11:21,277 --> 01:11:24,941
According to our reports,
her ship exploded in midair.

744
01:11:25,982 --> 01:11:28,542
MAN: How shall we proceed, sir?

745
01:11:28,718 --> 01:11:31,016
Do the villagers know
that their princess's ship went down?

746
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:32,855
- No, sir.
- Good. Keep it that way.

747
01:11:33,022 --> 01:11:34,956
Continue working
as if nothing has changed.

748
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:36,314
ALL: Yes, sir.

749
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:47,032
So, is this lowly soldier
finally on the path to fame and fortune,

750
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,770
or on the path to destruction?

751
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,379
LordYupa,
Mito and the others are back.

752
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,846
They're all waiting for you
at the Acid Lake.

753
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,855
Down there.

754
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,565
MITO: We shouldn't have returned
without the Princess.

755
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,074
LORDYUPA: No, I'm glad
that all of you are safe.

756
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:34,908
You're letting me go?

757
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,816
LORDYUPA:Yes, granted that you
drown the giant warrior in the Acid Lake

758
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:40,922
and then return to your kingdom.

759
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,320
You have very few soldiers
left in the valley.

760
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,324
We could easily defeat your forces now,

761
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,792
but I see no point in further killing.

762
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:50,058
The warrior can't be
drowned or destroyed,

763
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,596
and until it walks on its own,
it can't be moved.

764
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,669
Don't you understand? It's too late.

765
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,033
There's no turning back now.

766
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,002
I was ordered to attack Pejite
because we feared

767
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,038
another kingdom would
get a hold of the warrior's power.

768
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,814
Once its existence is known,

769
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:09,680
all the remaining kingdoms
will send their armies here to claim it.

770
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:14,048
You really only have
one choice, Lord Yupa.

771
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,349
Revive the giant warrior.

772
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,459
Use it to repel the invading kingdoms

773
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,822
and learn to live with the monster.

774
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:21,964
Look.

775
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,497
(GASPING)

776
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:26,793
Hmm.

777
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,061
An insect did that?

778
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,033
That's right, and whatever
lucky man becomes my husband

779
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,875
will see worse than that.

780
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,635
The insects must be stopped.

781
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,905
You must revive the warrior and use it
to destroy them and their jungle.

782
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,643
Steal it from us
as we stole it from Pejite.

783
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,751
That's what I'd do if I were you.

784
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,385
No, we will keep the warrior dormant
as it was meant to be.

785
01:13:49,892 --> 01:13:51,382
(GASPING) Lord Yupa!

786
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:53,986
- Emergency!
-You gotta give us the password.

787
01:13:54,163 --> 01:13:55,961
-I'mina humy!
-Wind?

788
01:13:56,132 --> 01:13:57,793
-Valley!
- Okay.

789
01:13:57,967 --> 01:14:00,834
- Some of the spores survived!
-What? In the valley?

790
01:14:01,003 --> 01:14:04,166
They're spreading poison everywhere.
The whole valley's in a panic.

791
01:14:04,540 --> 01:14:06,474
(PANICKED MURMURING)

792
01:14:08,210 --> 01:14:09,905
WOMAN: It's poison! See them?

793
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:11,808
(CLAMORING)

794
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:14,449
MAN 1: Please, don't be foolish!
MAN 2: We need to do something.

795
01:14:14,617 --> 01:14:16,107
- MAN 3: Hurry!
- MAN 1: Before it's too late!

796
01:14:17,820 --> 01:14:20,790
If we don't do something fast,
the whole valley will be destroyed.

797
01:14:20,957 --> 01:14:21,890
Hurry, the spores are spreading fast.

798
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:25,790
If we give them tools to burn the spores,
they could use them against us instead.

799
01:14:25,962 --> 01:14:28,829
We have no choice.
Hand over everything but their guns.

800
01:14:28,998 --> 01:14:29,897
Yes, sir.

801
01:14:30,066 --> 01:14:32,933
- Sir, the ship is ready.
-Try not to fail this time.

802
01:14:33,102 --> 01:14:35,434
Assemble all the Tolmekian soldiers
left in Pejite

803
01:14:35,604 --> 01:14:36,901
- and bring them to the valley.
-Yes, sir.

804
01:14:37,540 --> 01:14:38,564
What a mess.

805
01:14:38,841 --> 01:14:40,900
This is starting to look bad already.

806
01:14:41,077 --> 01:14:43,068
(ALL SHOUTING) Come on! Hurry!

807
01:14:43,245 --> 01:14:44,440
Let's go! Let's go!

808
01:14:46,816 --> 01:14:48,181
Good luck finding the Princess.

809
01:14:48,551 --> 01:14:51,179
Take care of the valley, and don't do
anything rash while we're gone.

ALL: Yes, sir.

811
01:14:57,159 --> 01:14:59,787

the entire tree.

818

This one's infected, too!

OBABA: This forest is doomed.

825
01:15:32,928 --> 01:15:34,487
We must burn it down.

826
01:15:34,663 --> 01:15:39,533
If we hesitate, the toxic jungle
will engulf the entire valley.

827
01:15:40,603 --> 01:15:42,128
Isn't there some other way?

828
01:15:42,304 --> 01:15:46,241
This forest has protected the valley
from the jungle's poisons for 300 years.

829
01:15:46,609 --> 01:15:49,510
If only the Tolmekians had never come.

830
01:15:57,086 --> 01:15:59,578
It looks like
things are getting out of control.

831
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:02,187
We better get back there fast.

832
01:16:15,071 --> 01:16:18,097
ASBEL: You think so?
Everything looks the same to me.

833

have left the jungle.

What's going on?
My heart's pounding like crazy.

835

ASBEL: Hey, we're almost there!
Pejite's just over that mountain.

836
01:16:54,176 --> 01:16:55,610
Something strange is going on.

837
01:16:55,778 --> 01:16:57,246
What's that haze over there?

838
01:17:02,051 --> 01:17:03,280
Asbel, put your mask on!

839
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:08,983
ASBEL: The insects. They're all dead.

840
01:17:09,291 --> 01:17:11,282
-We've got to get to Pejite.
- Be careful.

841
01:17:11,660 --> 01:17:13,992

could still be there.

ASBEL: And the capital's
been destroyed.

846
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:22,423
Pejite is finished.

847
01:18:22,798 --> 01:18:26,098
It was far too much to pay, even if it
did get the Tolmekians out of our city.

848
01:18:26,268 --> 01:18:27,167
"Too much to pay"?

849
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:29,327
Asbel, what are you talking about?

850
01:18:33,108 --> 01:18:34,041
An airship.

What have you done to our city?
It's completely destroyed!

854
01:18:55,130 --> 01:18:56,962
Don't worry. We can rebuild it.

855
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,362
And if the jungle starts to spread here,
we'll burn it off.

856
01:18:59,735 --> 01:19:02,170
With what? The giant warrior isn't here.

857
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:04,329
We know. It's in the Valley of the Wind.

858
01:19:04,506 --> 01:19:05,405
How do you know that?

859
01:19:05,774 --> 01:19:09,074
(CHUCKLES) We've already
made plans to get it back.

Our plan is being executed
as we speak.

861

All Tolmekians in the valley
will be dead...

01:19:16,318 --> 01:19:18,377
What are you planning to do
to my valley?

864

Asbel, who is this?

865
01:19:21,857 --> 01:19:24,121
She's the princess
of the Valley of the Wind,

866
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:25,454
and she saved my life.

Asbel, you know what the plan is.
You have to tell me.

What a monstrous thing to do.

875
01:19:52,288 --> 01:19:55,223
We have to get the giant warrior
out of the hands of the Tolmekians,

876

no matter what it takes.

877

We're doing this for the good
of the planet. You've got to understand.

The good of the planet?
You're killing my people!

Once the insects start stampeding,
they can't be stopped.

882

The Tolmekians nearly
killed off all our people.

883

Things may seem
bad to you now, Princess,

890
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,330

the jungle, and take back the Earth.

891

You savages!
You're just as bad as the Tolmekians!

892

You're wrong. The Tolmekians
want to take over the world.

Listen, every one of us
relies on water from the wells,

all the lakes and rivers.

But do you know why
the well water is pure?

896
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:55,811
The trees of the wasteland purify it.

898

You must not burn down
the toxic jungle!

899
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,552
You should have left the giant warrior
beneath the Earth!

900
01:21:03,325 --> 01:21:04,554
So what should we do?

901
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,952
Surrender and become
the slaves of the Tolmekians?

902

Don't you understand?

903
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,429
Asbel, tell them how the jungle evolved,

904
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:13,933

so we won't pollute the world again.

and avoid the mess?

1055
01:31:39,027 --> 01:31:41,724
Do you know anything
about that old ship they're hiding in?

1056
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:44,456
KUROTOWA: I've heard it was built
before the Seven Days of Fire.

1057
01:31:44,632 --> 01:31:45,497
I don't know if it's true,

1058
01:31:45,667 --> 01:31:48,034
but it's supposed to have traveled
everywhere, even to the stars.

1059
01:31:48,203 --> 01:31:50,831
They say guns can't
penetrate its armor,

1060
01:31:51,006 --> 01:31:52,872
but I bet if you hit it just right...

1061
01:31:53,041 --> 01:31:54,566
No, we're going to wait for the Princess.

1062
01:31:54,843 --> 01:31:55,935
What?

1063
01:31:56,111 --> 01:32:00,173
I want to see if she can make it back
alive from the middle of the jungle.

1064
01:32:00,548 --> 01:32:04,075
If she's not dead, I'd like a chance
to get to know her.

1065
01:32:07,288 --> 01:32:09,848
So, men, have you
made up your minds yet?

1066
01:32:10,025 --> 01:32:13,188
If you advise the villagers
to surrender, I'll let you go.

1067
01:32:13,928 --> 01:32:15,987
Or would you rather end up like Pejite?

1068
01:32:17,298 --> 01:32:19,858
It's strange that you're a princess, too.

1069
01:32:20,035 --> 01:32:22,902
You're not anything at all
like our princess.

1070
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:24,867
Ah, take a look at my hands.

1071
01:32:25,540 --> 01:32:27,770
I have the same illness as King Jihl.

1072
01:32:27,942 --> 01:32:31,776
Six months from now,
my hands will be as hard as rocks.

1073
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:36,975
But our princess told me that she truly
loves these beat-up old hands of mine.

1074
01:32:38,086 --> 01:32:39,576
When she looks at these hands,

1075
01:32:39,854 --> 01:32:41,845
she knows these
are the hands of a hard worker.

1076
01:32:42,190 --> 01:32:45,057
How can you be so foolish?
The jungle is killing you,

1077
01:32:45,226 --> 01:32:46,853
yet you want to live in harmony with it?

1078
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:49,222
You plan to burn down the jungle,

1079
01:32:49,597 --> 01:32:52,225
but we've learned to use fire
only in small amounts.

1080
01:32:52,600 --> 01:32:55,797
That's right.
Too much fire gives birth to nothing.

1081
01:32:55,970 --> 01:32:58,996
Fire can reduce a forest
to ashes in a day,

1082
01:32:59,174 --> 01:33:02,940
while it takes the water and the wind
100 years to grow one anew.

1083
01:33:03,111 --> 01:33:05,808
We prefer the ways
of the water and the wind.

1084
01:33:05,980 --> 01:33:10,144
The Princess will be devastated
when she sees that our forest is gone.

1085
01:33:11,886 --> 01:33:14,014
Sir. Do we have any orders yet, sir?

1086
01:33:14,189 --> 01:33:16,157
- Just shut up.
-Yes, sir.

1087
01:33:20,261 --> 01:33:21,626
Something must have happened,

1088
01:33:21,896 --> 01:33:23,625
because she's starting to look
kind of cute to me.

1089
01:33:24,132 --> 01:33:26,658
Kurotowa, prepare the troops to attack.

1090
01:33:27,202 --> 01:33:29,170
What? We're not going to wait?

1091
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:33,939
We'll begin the attack in one hour,
so get the troops fed and ready to go.

You're gonna fly me back to the herd,

their baby back to them.
