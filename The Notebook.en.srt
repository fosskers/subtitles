253
00:14:55,195 --> 00:14:58,562
- YOU'RE GONNA           
         GET RUN OVER.          
       - BY ALL THE CARS?

254
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:08,039
MY DAD AND I USED    
           TO COME OUT HERE

255
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:11,809
AND LAY DOWN AND WATCH
          THE LIGHTS CHANGE.

256

<i> AND WATCH THEM GO</i>       
       <i> FROM GREEN TO RED</i>       
          <i> TO YELLOW.</i>

257
00:15:16,449 --> 00:15:19,250
YOU COULD TRY IT,
               IF YOU WANTED TO.

258
00:15:19,252 --> 00:15:21,685
- NO.                
           - WHY NOT?

259
00:15:21,687 --> 00:15:24,488
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW--       
   WILL YOU JUST GET UP?

260
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:26,824
THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM,
            YOU KNOW THAT?

261
00:15:28,228 --> 00:15:29,693
YOU DON'T DO  
                  WHAT YOU WANT.

262
00:15:38,171 --> 00:15:39,637
OKAY.

00:15:48,581 --> 00:15:50,014

264
00:15:56,923 --> 00:15:58,923
WHAT HAPPENS                    
IF A CAR COMES?

265
00:15:58,925 --> 00:16:00,658
- WE DIE.         
              - WHAT?

266
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:02,626
JUST RELAX.    
                 JUST TRUST.

267
00:16:02,628 --> 00:16:04,996
YOU NEED TO LEARN
               HOW TO TRUST.

268
00:16:06,766 --> 00:16:08,166
OKAY.

269
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,071
- PAINTING.              
       - HMM?

270
00:16:13,073 --> 00:16:15,673
YOU ASKED ME              
      WHAT I DO FOR ME.

271
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:19,444
- WHAT NOW?            
         - I LOVE TO PAINT.

272
00:16:19,446 --> 00:16:22,680

           - MM-HMM.

273
00:16:22,682 --> 00:16:24,782
HUH.

00:16:24,784 --> 00:16:28,752
MOST OF THE TIME,               
I HAVE ALL THESE THOUGHTS       
BOUNCING AROUND IN MY HEAD.

00:16:28,754 --> 00:16:32,090

00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,117
Duke's voice:          
 <i> IT WAS AN IMPROBABLE ROMANCE.</i>

379
00:22:00,119 --> 00:22:03,987
<i> HE WAS A COUNTRY BOY.</i>     
    <i> SHE WAS FROM THE CITY.</i>

380
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:05,756
<i> SHE HAD THE WORLD</i>       
         <i> AT HER FEET,</i>

381
00:22:05,758 --> 00:22:07,991
<i> WHILE HE DIDN'T HAVE</i>      
  <i> TWO DIMES TO RUB TOGETHER.</i>

382
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,560
( excited screaming )

383
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:14,264
NOAH, COME ON.

384
00:22:15,435 --> 00:22:16,434
WHOO!

385
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,669
LOOK AT US.

386
00:22:21,374 --> 00:22:22,673
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

387
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:25,476
DO YOU THINK IN ANOTHER LIFE,   
I COULD HAVE BEEN A BIRD?

388
00:22:27,613 --> 00:22:28,779
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

389
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:30,848
LIKE REINCARNATION.

390
00:22:31,951 --> 00:22:33,851
I DON'T KNOW.

391
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,453
<i> I THINK I COULD.</i>

392
00:22:35,455 --> 00:22:39,490
( cooing )

393
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:42,993
SAY I'M A BIRD.

394
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,763
NO.

395
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:47,832
- DON'T DO IT.           
       - SAY I'M A BIRD.

396
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:49,834
- STOP IT.  STOP IT NOW.    
    - ( screaming )

397
00:22:49,836 --> 00:22:51,535
- YOU'RE NOT.          
         - SAY IT!

398
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:56,073
- YOU'RE A BIRD.        
        - YEAH.

399
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,614
NOW SAY           
              YOU'RE A BIRD TOO.

400
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,519
IF YOU'RE A BIRD,         
      I'M A BIRD.

401
00:23:14,059 --> 00:23:16,861
( hoedown music playing )

402
00:23:42,121 --> 00:23:44,321
- COME ON, DARLING.        
     - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

403
00:23:44,323 --> 00:23:45,956
DON'T.                  
        DON'T!

404
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:53,230
( excited screams )

405
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,735
HERE WE GO,           
  ON THE COUNT OF THREE, OKAY?

406
00:23:57,737 --> 00:24:00,270
<i> REAL EASY,</i>           
          <i> ON THREE, READY?</i>

407
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:01,872

GET IN THE WATER!

411

    - Fin:<i> COME ON, CHICKEN.</i>

412
00:24:10,215 --> 00:24:12,182
GET IN THE WATER, BABY.     
    BABY, WOULD YOU GET IN.

413
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:14,217
- GET IN THE WATER.      
       - I CAN'T.

414
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,719
- GO!                     
      - GET IN THE WATER!

( car backfiring )

419
00:24:30,069 --> 00:24:32,369
KEEP 'EM TOGETHER!              
NO, NO, NO.

420
00:24:32,371 --> 00:24:34,304
- GET TO YOUR PLACE.      
      - DOWN HERE.

421
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,807
AND MOVE.                     
  AND KEEP IT.

422
00:24:36,809 --> 00:24:39,743
- NO, DON'T MOVE IT!         
   - I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT    
     YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

423
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:42,245
Duke's voice:          
  <i> THEY DIDN'T AGREE ON MUCH.</i>

424
00:24:42,247 --> 00:24:45,082
<i> IN FACT, THEY</i>         
  <i> RARELY AGREED ON ANYTHING.</i>   
   <i> THEY FOUGHT ALL THE TIME.</i>

00:24:45,084 --> 00:24:46,717
- DON'T KICK ME!        
        - DON'T PUSH ME.

426
00:24:46,719 --> 00:24:49,152
<i> AND THEY CHALLENGED</i>      
     <i> EACH OTHER EVERY DAY.</i>

      <i> THEIR DIFFERENCES,</i>

00:24:54,226 --> 00:24:56,794
<i> THEY WERE CRAZY</i>        
       <i> ABOUT EACH OTHER.</i>

430
00:24:58,931 --> 00:25:00,297
OKAY,                
           I HAVE TO GO.

431
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,299
- NO.                 
          - YES, I DO.

OH, DADDY YOU'RE--

435
00:25:20,285 --> 00:25:22,786
I DIDN'T                        
SEE YOU THERE.

436
00:25:22,788 --> 00:25:24,722
YOU KINDA            
           SCARED ME.

437
00:25:27,393 --> 00:25:29,994
BECOMING FRIENDLY        
       WITH THAT BOY DOWN THERE.

438
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:33,864
YES.

439
00:25:35,234 --> 00:25:36,867
BRING HIM              
         TO THE HOUSE ON SUNDAY.

440
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,869
I WANT TO MEET 
                 THIS YOUNG MAN.

441
00:25:38,871 --> 00:25:41,672
OKAY.

442
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:42,873
GOOD NIGHT, DADDY.

443
00:25:42,875 --> 00:25:44,808
GOOD NIGHT.

00:25:48,514 --> 00:25:49,813
( laughs )

445
00:25:51,684 --> 00:25:52,883
OH, BOY.

446
00:25:52,885 --> 00:25:54,685
THIS BUG GOES                   
"DADDY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND."

447
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:59,156
HE GOES, "WELL, IN THEORY,   
   WE'RE BOTH MILLIONAIRES,     
   BUT IN REALITY,

448
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,724
WE LIVE WITH        
            A BUNCH OF WHORES."

BISHOP STEVENS         
         TOLD ME THAT.

 <i>  A LITTLE TOO MUCH TO DRINK.</i>  
 - LOOK AT HER.

453
00:26:13,105 --> 00:26:14,538
PAY ATTENTION.

454
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:17,140
SO, WHAT DO    
                 YOU DO, NOAH?

455
00:26:17,142 --> 00:26:20,044
I WORK AT                
       THE LUMBER YARD WITH FIN.

456
00:26:20,046 --> 00:26:24,214
MAINLY MILLING         
         AND RECEIVING LOGS--   
         AND STRIPPING THE BARK.

457
00:26:24,216 --> 00:26:25,749
OH, THAT'S LOVELY, DEAR.

458
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,484
THANK YOU.

459
00:26:27,486 --> 00:26:30,054
IF YOU DON'T MIND       
        MY ASKING, UH, HOW MUCH 
        DO YOU MAKE AT YOUR JOB?

460
00:26:30,056 --> 00:26:31,889
UH, HOW MUCH MONEY  
            DO I MAKE?

461
00:26:31,891 --> 00:26:33,824
MM-HMM.

462
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,326
ABOUT 40 CENTS                
  AN HOUR.

463
00:26:39,065 --> 00:26:42,032
YEAH, IT'S NOT MUCH,   
         BUT I DON'T NEED A LOT.

464
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,101
AND I--           
              I SAVE MOST OF IT.

465
00:26:45,972 --> 00:26:47,537
LET'S EAT.  SHALL WE?

466
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:50,607

     - Woman:<i> YES! OH,</i>          
     <i>  IT LOOKS DELICIOUS.</i>

467
00:26:53,145 --> 00:26:56,346
SO NOAH, YOU AND ALLIE    
      HAVE BEEN SPENDING        
      A LOT OF TIME TOGETHER.

468
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:00,417
<i> YOU MUST BE VERY FOND</i>
          <i> OF EACH OTHER.</i>

469
00:27:02,321 --> 00:27:04,688
<i> IT'S GETTING</i>        
           <i> PRETTY SERIOUS, HUH?</i>

470
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:06,457
YES, MA'AM.

471

WELL,                 
          SUMMER'S ALMOST GONE. 
          WHAT WILL YOU DO?

472
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:13,296
YOU KNOW, CHARLESTON'S      
    ONLY A COUPLE OF HOURS AWAY.

473
00:27:15,534 --> 00:27:17,468
BUT ALLIE'S GOING     
          TO SARAH LAWRENCE.

474
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:21,037
DIDN'T SHE TELL YOU?

475
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:23,106
NO, SHE DIDN'T    
              TELL ME THAT.

476
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:27,778
I JUST GOT THE LETTER.          
I WAS GOING TO TELL YOU.

477
00:27:27,780 --> 00:27:28,745
IT'S OKAY.

00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:31,949
AND SARAH LAWRENCE
              IS IN NEW YORK.

479
00:27:35,554 --> 00:27:37,554
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.

480
00:27:39,091 --> 00:27:42,559
ANNE, THIS CONVERSATION'S    
TOO STUFFY FOR THE DINNER TABLE.

481
00:27:42,561 --> 00:27:45,929
LET THE CHILDREN        
   HAVE FUN WITHOUT BRINGING    
  IN THE SPANISH INQUISITION.

482
00:27:45,931 --> 00:27:48,131
MY LIPS ARE BUTTONED,  
         RIGHT NOW.

483
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:51,702
I DO KNOW ANOTHER JOKE    
      ABOUT THE NUN AND THE FULL

( all laughing )

485
00:27:53,706 --> 00:27:56,106
- THAT WASN'T ME.            
   - I'M LEAVING THE TABLE      
     IF YOU TELL ANOTHER JOKE.

486
00:27:58,844 --> 00:28:00,243
WHOO!

487
00:28:00,245 --> 00:28:01,545
I'M GONNA DO IT.

( excited screams )

490
00:28:09,254 --> 00:28:12,523
THAT CHILD'S GOT          
      TOO MUCH SPIRIT FOR A GIRL
      OF HER CIRCUMSTANCE.

491
00:28:12,525 --> 00:28:15,592
<i> NAH, IT'S JUST</i>

00:28:26,505 --> 00:28:28,038
- MMM.             
             - MMM.

<i> IS THAT ALLIE</i>

00:28:45,558 --> 00:28:48,291
- ( panting )       
            - DO YOU WANT       
              TO GO SOMEWHERE?

496
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:51,628
OKAY.

497
00:28:57,135 --> 00:28:58,368
WAIT HERE.

498
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,390

00:29:33,706 --> 00:29:35,505
ALL RIGHT,      
                JUST STAY THERE.

503
00:29:35,507 --> 00:29:37,608
DON'T OPEN   
                   YOUR EYES.

504
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:46,282
OKAY.

505
00:29:46,284 --> 00:29:48,551
THE WINDSOR PLANTATION.

506
00:29:48,553 --> 00:29:51,121
IT WAS BUILT IN 1772.

507
00:29:51,123 --> 00:29:53,456
- RUMOR HAS IT THAT       
        FRANCIS MARION...

    - WATCH OUT.

510
00:29:59,297 --> 00:30:01,397
YOU BE CAREFUL,                 
THESE ARE BROKEN.               
LOOK AT THAT.

511
00:30:01,399 --> 00:30:03,399

    - THIS--

512
00:30:03,401 --> 00:30:05,201
THIS PLACE IS GIGANTIC.

513
00:30:05,203 --> 00:30:07,403
<i> YEAH, A GIGANTIC</i>               
<i> PIECE OF CRAP.</i>

514
00:30:07,405 --> 00:30:09,906
- ( laughing )                  
-<i> IT IS.</i>

515
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:13,110
BUT I'M GONNA           
        BUY IT ONE DAY          
        AND I'M GONNA FIX IT UP.

516
00:30:13,112 --> 00:30:14,811
ALL IT NEEDS          
        IS A NEW FLOOR.

517
00:30:16,048 --> 00:30:17,814
AND NEW WALLS          
          AND A ROOF.

518
00:30:17,816 --> 00:30:20,917
- IS THAT ALL?          
        - AND PLUMBING          
          AND ELECTRIC.

519
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,419
- AND FURNITURE.          
      - YES, AND FURNITURE.

520
00:30:23,421 --> 00:30:25,055
BUT IT'S RIGHT                  
ON THE WATER.

521
00:30:25,057 --> 00:30:26,890
AND THERE'S A BIG               
OLD BARN OUT THERE--

522
00:30:26,892 --> 00:30:29,092
I COULD TURN THAT               
INTO MY WORKSHOP.

523
00:30:29,094 --> 00:30:31,227
WELL, WHAT ABOUT ME?

524
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:32,663
NOW DON'T I GET          
       ANY SAY IN THIS?

525
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:36,833
YOU WANT A SAY IN THIS?

526
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:39,670
<i> YES, I WOULD.</i>

527
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:41,038
WHAT DO YOU WANT?

528
00:30:41,040 --> 00:30:42,338
<i> I WANT</i>

    - MM-HMM.

530
00:30:45,044 --> 00:30:47,644
AND A ROOM OVERLOOKING     
     THE RIVER SO I CAN PAINT.

531
00:30:48,747 --> 00:30:50,280
- ANYTHING ELSE?        
        - YES.

532
00:30:50,282 --> 00:30:54,217
I WANT A BIG             
       OLD PORCH THAT WRAPS     
       AROUND THE ENTIRE HOUSE.

533
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:55,952
- WE CAN DRINK TEA...     
      - WHOA, WHOA, WHOA--

534
00:30:55,954 --> 00:30:57,620
AND WATCH         
              THE SUN GO DOWN.

535
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:01,858
- OKAY.               
          - YOU PROMISE?

536
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:04,360
MM-HMM,               
          I PROMISE.

537
00:31:04,362 --> 00:31:05,628
GOOD.

538
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:09,432
- WHERE ARE YOU GOING?     
     - IN HERE.

539
00:31:12,971 --> 00:31:14,470
<i> WOW.</i>

540
00:31:25,084 --> 00:31:27,784

541
00:31:58,016 --> 00:31:59,415
( laughs )

542
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:02,853
I CAN'T PLAY CHOPSTICKS     
      WITH YOU DOING THAT.

543
00:32:21,807 --> 00:32:24,241
( panting )    
                 OH, GOD.

544
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:26,076
OH, MAKE LOVE TO ME.

545
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:22,025
- NOAH.             
            - YEAH?

546
00:34:22,027 --> 00:34:24,627
UM...

547
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:27,030
I KNOW I SAID                   
THAT I WANTED YOU               
TO MAKE LOVE TO ME,

548
00:34:27,032 --> 00:34:28,265
- BUT I THINK YOU--       
      - YEAH?

549
00:34:28,267 --> 00:34:30,500
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE               
TO TALK ME THROUGH THIS.

550
00:34:30,502 --> 00:34:32,668
( panting )

551
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:35,238
- RIGHT. YOU ALL RIGHT?      
   - YEAH.

552
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:37,007
- DID I HURT YOU?        
       - NO, NO.

553
00:34:37,009 --> 00:34:39,876

LIKE WHAT ARE YOU THINKING? 
    WHAT ARE YOU THINKING,      
    RIGHT NOW?

557
00:34:53,758 --> 00:34:56,192
YOU KNOW,               
        RIGHT THIS SECOND?

558
00:34:56,194 --> 00:34:57,928
UH...

559
00:34:57,930 --> 00:35:01,264
DID YOU KNOW THAT               
THIS WAS GOING TO HAPPEN        
WHEN YOU BROUGHT ME HERE?

560
00:35:01,266 --> 00:35:02,532
- NO.              
             - NO?

561
00:35:02,534 --> 00:35:06,036
- NO.                       
    - NO, YOU DIDN'T            
      THINK ABOUT IT?

562
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:08,371
- OF COURSE I THOUGHT ABOUT IT. 
- YOU DID?

563
00:35:08,373 --> 00:35:11,141
- UH-HUH.

UH, I'M TALKING                 
TOO MUCH, AREN'T I?

565
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:16,079
OKAY, OKAY,                     
I'M JUST GOING TO SHUT UP.

566
00:35:16,081 --> 00:35:17,613
MUM'S THE WORD.

I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND        
 HOW COME YOU'RE SO QUIET.

571

YOU DON'T HAVE                  
ONE THOUGHT?

BUT NO, WITH YOU, 
              EVERYTHING'S FINE.

574
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,467
YOU DON'T HAVE      
            A CARE IN THE WORLD?

575
00:35:45,510 --> 00:35:47,410
I'M SORRY.

576
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:50,180
I WANTED THIS                
   TO BE SO PERFECT.

577
00:35:50,182 --> 00:35:52,248
NOW I CAN'T SHUT UP.

YEAH.

582
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:36,493
YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS       
IF YOU DON'T WANT TO.

583
00:36:36,495 --> 00:36:39,762
NO, NO, I WANT TO,  
            I DO.

LOOK, I'M SORRY,             
   BUT ALLIE'S PARENTS          
   ARE GOING CRAZY.

587
00:36:47,939 --> 00:36:49,906
THEY GOT                    
    EVERY COP IN TOWN           
    OUT LOOKING FOR HER.

588
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:00,150

592
00:37:11,029 --> 00:37:13,096
MR. HAMILTON,        
           ALL THIS IS MY FAULT.

593
00:37:13,098 --> 00:37:15,065
WOULD YOU GIVE US               
A MOMENT PLEASE?

594
00:37:15,067 --> 00:37:18,000
I'D LIKE TO TALK                
TO MY DAUGHTER.

595
00:37:18,002 --> 00:37:19,702

SIR, IT'S REALLY 
               NOT HER FAULT.

600
00:37:41,659 --> 00:37:43,326
I LOST TRACK   
                 OF TIME.

607
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:20,196

            TO STOP.

608
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:21,998
I DIDN'T SPEND                  
17 YEARS OF MY LIFE

609
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:25,301

   AND GIVING HER EVERYTHING... 
 - ( scoffs )

610
00:38:25,303 --> 00:38:27,537
SO SHE COULD THROW IT AWAY      
ON A SUMMER ROMANCE.

611
00:38:27,539 --> 00:38:30,206
- DADDY, COME ON!

NOW THAT IS ENOUGH.             
YOU ARE NOT TO SEE HIM          
ANYMORE.  AND THAT'S FINAL.

618

00:40:17,682 --> 00:40:19,915
I GOT TO THINK     
             ABOUT SOME STUFF.

642
00:40:19,917 --> 00:40:22,452
WHAT DO YOU                    
 GOT TO THINK ABOUT, HUH?

643
00:40:22,454 --> 00:40:24,387
COME HERE                       
AND TALK TO ME.

644
00:40:24,389 --> 00:40:25,988
TALK TO ME!

645
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,990
ABOUT WHAT?  
                   YOU WANT--

646
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,692
YOU'RE GOING AWAY!

647
00:40:31,396 --> 00:40:33,596
YOU'RE LEAVING.

648
00:40:33,598 --> 00:40:36,266
AND I'M STAYING HERE.

649
00:40:36,268 --> 00:40:38,968
AND I'M SO HAPPY     
           THAT YOU'RE DOING IT,

650
00:40:38,970 --> 00:40:41,404
BUT YOU'RE GONNA 
               HAVE A MILLION   
               THINGS TO DO.

651
00:40:41,406 --> 00:40:43,139
- NO.                 
          - YOU GOT SO MUCH     
            AHEAD OF YOU.

652
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:45,107
- DON'T TALK LIKE THAT.     
    - IT'S TRUE.

653
00:40:45,109 --> 00:40:48,978
I'M NOT GOING TO HAVE     
      NICE THINGS, FANCY THINGS.

654
00:40:48,980 --> 00:40:51,514
IT DOESN'T--

655
00:40:51,516 --> 00:40:54,083
IT'S NEVER                   
   GONNA HAPPEN FOR ME.         
   IT'S NOT IN THE CARDS FOR ME.

656
00:40:54,085 --> 00:40:55,951
I DON'T HAVE                  
  TO GO TO SCHOOL, OKAY?

657
00:40:55,953 --> 00:40:57,620
- YES, YOU DO.        
          - I CAN STAY HERE.

658
00:40:57,622 --> 00:41:00,122
NO.  DO YOU SEE,       
         THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT    
         I AM TALKING ABOUT.

659
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,391
THEN YOU CAN              
      COME WITH ME.

660
00:41:02,761 --> 00:41:04,860
- TO NEW YORK?         
         - YES.

661
00:41:06,798 --> 00:41:08,498
WHAT AM I GOING      
           TO DO IN NEW YORK?

662
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:12,468
BE WITH ME?

663
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:19,275
YEAH.

664
00:41:22,113 --> 00:41:23,680
I DON'T KNOW.

665
00:41:28,553 --> 00:41:31,153
WE DON'T GOT         
           TO FIGURE ALL THIS   
           OUT TONIGHT, YA KNOW?

666
00:41:31,155 --> 00:41:33,656
WE'LL FINISH OUT      
          THE SUMMER AND WE'LL  
          SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

667
00:41:35,059 --> 00:41:36,926
YOU SAYING YOU WANT            
 TO BREAK IT OFF?

668
00:41:36,928 --> 00:41:39,729
WHAT I'M SAYING,      
          WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES 
          LATER ON.

669
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:48,671
ARE YOU BREAKING UP           
  WITH ME?

670
00:41:51,376 --> 00:41:53,343
I DON'T SEE           
          HOW IT'S GONNA WORK.

671
00:41:53,345 --> 00:41:54,777
( sobs )

672
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:57,213
I SEE...

673
00:41:58,850 --> 00:42:01,250
PLEASE DON'T DO THIS.

674
00:42:01,252 --> 00:42:02,652
YOU DON'T MEAN IT.

675
00:42:04,055 --> 00:42:06,389
OH HELL, WELL IF YOU'RE         
GOING TO DO IT,

676
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:08,458
WHY WAIT UNTIL                  
THE SUMMER ENDS, HUH?

677
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,727
WHY DON'T YOU                 
  JUST DO IT, RIGHT NOW?

678
00:42:10,729 --> 00:42:12,462
HUH?

679
00:42:12,464 --> 00:42:13,763
COME ON.

680
00:42:13,765 --> 00:42:15,130
- COME ON.              
        - WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

681
00:42:15,132 --> 00:42:17,233
DO IT!      
                    DO IT!

682
00:42:17,235 --> 00:42:18,934
DO IT RIGHT NOW.

683
00:42:18,936 --> 00:42:21,704
DO IT!                   
       ( screams )

684
00:42:21,706 --> 00:42:22,872
STOP IT!

685
00:42:22,874 --> 00:42:24,139
OH!

686
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:26,876
YOU KNOW WHAT?              
    I'M GONNA DO IT.            
    IT'S OVER.

687
00:42:26,878 --> 00:42:28,878
OKAY?  IT'S OVER.

688
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:31,414
- COME HERE.             
       - DON'T TOUCH ME.

689
00:42:31,416 --> 00:42:33,449
I HATE YOU,                   
  I HATE YOU.

690
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:34,751
I'M GONNA GO.

691
00:42:34,753 --> 00:42:37,286
WHY DON'T YOU,              
    WHY DON'T YOU               
    JUST GO.  GET OUT.

692
00:42:37,288 --> 00:42:40,923
LEAVE!             
             GO!  GO!

693
00:42:42,794 --> 00:42:45,528
NO, NO, JUST WAIT A MINUTE.  
   WE'RE NOT REALLY BREAKING UP,
   ARE WE?

694
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,629
COME ON.

695
00:42:46,631 --> 00:42:48,197
THIS IS JUST A FIGHT      
         WE'RE HAVING,

696
00:42:48,199 --> 00:42:51,200
AND TOMORROW IT WILL BE     
 LIKE IT NEVER HAPPENED, RIGHT?

697
00:42:56,875 --> 00:42:59,475
- GOING?      
                  - GONE.

698
00:42:59,477 --> 00:43:01,310
WELL, SHE MUST HAVE 
            BEEN DEVASTATED.

699
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:02,678
SHE WAS.

700
00:43:02,680 --> 00:43:06,115
- HE WAS ONLY TRYING        
      TO DO THE RIGHT THING.    
    - YEAH.

701
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:09,786
BUT WHAT HE REALLY SHOULD   
    HAVE DONE IS JUST TOLD THOSE
    PARENTS TO GO TO HELL.

702
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:11,654
JUST STICK IT               
    WHERE THE SUN DON'T SHINE.

703
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,690
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT,           
  PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE.

704
00:43:16,394 --> 00:43:18,728
Duke's voice:          
  <i> THE NEXT DAY, ALLIE WOKE UP</i>

705
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:21,196

      <i> COMPLETELY CHANGED.</i>

706
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,606
WHAT'S GOING ON?

707
00:43:30,608 --> 00:43:32,308
WE'RE GOING HOME.

708
00:43:33,478 --> 00:43:35,010
- WE'RE GOING NOW?          
    - MM-HMM.

709
00:43:35,012 --> 00:43:37,513
NO, WE'RE NOT           
        SUPPOSED TO BE LEAVING  
        FOR ANOTHER WEEK.

710
00:43:37,515 --> 00:43:40,249
GET DRESSED AND THEN            
COME AND HAVE SOME              
BREAKFAST, DEAR.

711
00:43:40,251 --> 00:43:41,784
WILLOW WILL PACK              
  YOUR THINGS.

712
00:43:41,786 --> 00:43:43,886
WHY, I'D BE HAPPY            
   TO PACK YOUR THINGS,         
   MISS ALLIE.

713
00:43:43,888 --> 00:43:45,220
<i> I DON'T WANT</i>          
         <i> YOU TO PACK MY THINGS.</i>

714
00:43:45,222 --> 00:43:47,389
I DON'T WANT YOU        
        TO TOUCH MY STUFF.      
        I'M NOT GOING.

715
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:48,891
- YES, YOU ARE.         
        - NO, I'M NOT.

716
00:43:48,893 --> 00:43:51,093
- YES, ALLIE, YOU ARE.     
     - NO, I'M NOT.

717
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:53,796
ALLIE, YOU ARE GOING            
WHETHER YOU LIKE IT             
OR NOT.

718
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:56,566
NOW, EVEN IF AARON            
  HAS TO THROW YOU OVER         
  HIS SHOULDER

719
00:43:56,568 --> 00:44:00,235
AND DRAG YOU THE WHOLE WAY,     
YOU'RE GOING.

720
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:05,942
EXCUSE ME.

721
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:07,510
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.      
    - COME ON.

722
00:44:07,512 --> 00:44:09,846
- WE HAVE TO HAVE               
  ALL THESE DONE BY LUNCH.      
- COME ON, GET ON!

723
00:44:09,848 --> 00:44:11,481
YOU SHOULDN'T BE           
     STANDING AROUND.           
     HERE WE GO.

724

WHERE'S NOAH?

727
00:44:20,191 --> 00:44:21,958
HE'S OUT                
        DELIVERING A LOAD.

728
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:25,761
- WHAT'S GOING ON?           
   - I'M LEAVING TOWN.

729
00:44:25,763 --> 00:44:27,363
- LEAVING?            
          - YEAH.

730
00:44:27,365 --> 00:44:29,899
- WHEN?                  
       - NOW, RIGHT NOW--       
         LIKE TODAY.

731
00:44:29,901 --> 00:44:32,034
( horn honks )

732
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,003
LOOK, I NEED         
           YOU TO TELL NOAH     
           SOMETHING, OKAY?

733
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:35,771
I NEED YOU        
              TO TELL HIM       
              THAT I LOVE HIM.

734
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:38,340
AND TELL HIM         
           THAT I'M SORRY       
           FOR EVERYTHING, OKAY?

735
00:44:38,342 --> 00:44:39,809
( sighs )

736
00:44:39,811 --> 00:44:42,979
LOOK, I WAS UP ALL NIGHT      
  WITH HIM, ALLIE.

737
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:44,547
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM           
  SO LOW.

738
00:44:44,549 --> 00:44:47,783
IT'S OVER.                      
DON'T MAKE IT ANY HARDER        
THAN IT ALREADY IS.

739
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:49,685
NO! NO, IT'S NOT OVER.

740
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:51,521
FIN, WE HAD A FIGHT 
            LAST NIGHT.

741
00:44:51,523 --> 00:44:54,156
NO, WE SAID SOME      
          THINGS WE DIDN'T MEAN,
          BUT IT'S NOT OVER.

742
00:44:54,158 --> 00:44:55,591
- IT IS OVER.          
         - NO.

743
00:44:55,593 --> 00:44:57,259
LEAVE IT ALONE.              
   LET IT GO.

744
00:44:57,261 --> 00:44:59,662
-<i> ( horn blares )</i>        
       - I'M COMING.

<i> MAMA, I'M COMING!</i>

746
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:07,770
- LOOK, HE UNDERSTANDS.     
    - BUT--

747
00:45:07,772 --> 00:45:10,172
IT'S HARD,                     
 BUT HE REALLY DOES.

748
00:45:10,174 --> 00:45:13,009
SUMMER'S OVER                   
AND IT'S TIME TO GO HOME.

749
00:45:13,011 --> 00:45:15,277
IF HE WANTS                 
    TO TALK TO YOU,             
    HE'LL WRITE.  IF NOT...?

750
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:23,085
OKAY.

751
00:45:23,087 --> 00:45:26,422
OKAY, CAN YOU JUST--  
          CAN YOU JUST TELL HIM 
          THAT I LOVE HIM, THEN?

752
00:45:26,424 --> 00:45:29,391
- CAN YOU DO THAT?       
       - I'LL TELL HIM.

753
00:45:34,599 --> 00:45:36,131
BYE, FIN.

754
00:46:18,242 --> 00:46:19,541
SHE'S GONE.

755
00:46:34,626 --> 00:46:37,793

A SPECTACULAR MOMENT     
       OF LIGHT IN THE HEAVENS,

00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:50,906
A FLEETING GLIMPSE

00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:55,077
AND IN A FLASH,                 
THEY'RE GONE.

SHE DOESN'T PLAN,      
         SHE PLOTS, DOESN'T SHE?

1020
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:17,365
( overlapping voices )

1021
01:02:17,367 --> 01:02:20,135
- MAMA, LOOK,               
      THE GOVERNOR'S COMING.    
    - HE BETTER. LET ME SEE.

1022
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,506

WELL, HELLO.        
            BABY, I DIDN'T KNOW 
            YOU WERE COMING.

1030

I'M-- I'M SO SORRY,           
  I SHOULD HAVE CALLED.

         YOU TALKING ABOUT?     
         YOU DON'T HAVE TO CALL.

01:03:30,808 --> 01:03:33,074
SO WHAT'S UP?

1036
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:36,511
I DON'T PAINT ANYMORE.

1037
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:40,882
I USED TO PAINT                 
ALL THE TIME.

1038
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:42,250
I REALLY LOVED IT.

1039
01:03:42,252 --> 01:03:44,986
- I DIDN'T KNOW THAT.      
     - YEAH.

1040
01:03:47,457 --> 01:03:48,824

1041
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:50,725
I WILL.

1042

- I'M GONNA START.       
       - GREAT.

1043
01:04:01,738 --> 01:04:03,438
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

1044
01:04:06,243 --> 01:04:07,675
I NEED TO GET AWAY.

1045
01:04:08,979 --> 01:04:10,145
OKAY.

1046
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:13,248
I NEED TO TAKE CARE          
   OF A FEW THINGS.

1047
01:04:13,250 --> 01:04:15,283
I NEED TO CLEAR              
   MY HEAD.

1048
01:04:15,285 --> 01:04:17,652
OKAY,               
            SHOULD I BE WORRIED?

1049
01:04:17,654 --> 01:04:20,956
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.     
    - OH, THAT'S REASSURING.

1050
01:04:22,492 --> 01:04:24,759

        - OKAY, THEN GO.

1052
01:04:28,565 --> 01:04:30,698
TAKE YOUR TIME,    
             DO WHATEVER YOU    
             NEED TO DO.

1053
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:32,934
IT'S OKAY TO BE NERVOUS, 
       ALL RIGHT?

1054
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:35,170
IT'S NORMAL TO GET 
             COLD FEET BEFORE   
             YOUR WEDDING.

1055
01:04:35,172 --> 01:04:37,239
NO, NO SECOND

01:04:41,845 --> 01:04:44,112
I LOVE YOU.

1057
01:04:44,114 --> 01:04:46,781
I'M GOING TO BE                 
BACK FROM SEABROOK              
IN A COUPLE OF DAYS, OKAY?

1058
01:04:47,951 --> 01:04:51,586

I SAW YOUR PICTURE

SO ARE YOU OKAY?

1069
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:10,131
OKAY, GOOD.

1070
01:06:14,637 --> 01:06:16,971
I'M A STUPID WOMAN,   
          I SHOULDN'T HAVE COME.

YOU WANT TO COME IN?

1074
01:06:40,430 --> 01:06:42,163
OKAY.

1075
01:06:44,968 --> 01:06:47,068
THIS IS           
              A GOOD STORY.

1076
01:06:47,070 --> 01:06:49,103
I'M GLAD                        
YOU LIKE IT.

1077
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:52,207
I THINK              
           I'VE HEARD IT BEFORE.

1078
01:06:54,344 --> 01:06:55,343
YES.

1080

DOCTOR NEEDS                    
TO SEE YOU.

1081
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:03,251
- ME?  NOW?           
          - NO, HIM.

BUT HE HASN'T FINISHED 
         READING HIS STORY.

THIS SHOULDN'T TAKE             
TOO LONG.

- ALL RIGHT.             
       - DON'T YOU GO AWAY.

1086

I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1087
01:07:14,965 --> 01:07:18,166
WHILE YOU WAITING, MAYBE      
  YOU'D LIKE TO PLAY THE PIANO  
  FOR A FEW MINUTES.

1088
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:19,167
YOU DO LIKE THAT.

1089
01:07:19,169 --> 01:07:21,369
- I DO?              
           - MM-HMM.

THAT YOU'VE HAD                 
TWO HEART ATTACKS               
OVER THE LAST 18 MONTHS.

1097
01:07:47,864 --> 01:07:50,198
YEAH, MINOR ONES,      
         I THINK ONE WAS ANGINA.

1098
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:53,201
- OKAY, ANY COMPLICATIONS?    
  - NOPE, FEEL FINE.

1099
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:55,736
OKAY, DEEP BREATH

TERRIFIC, TERRIFIC.             
YOU STILL TAKING                
YOUR MEDICATION?

1105

- GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

01:08:11,854 --> 01:08:14,222
OKAY, YOU CAN                 
  PUT YOUR SHIRT ON.

1107
01:08:19,429 --> 01:08:22,063
SO I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU        
READ TO MISS HAMILTON.

1108
01:08:22,065 --> 01:08:24,665
YEAH, TO HELP   
                HER REMEMBER.

1109
01:08:24,667 --> 01:08:27,001
- HMM.                   
       - YOU DON'T THINK        
         IT'LL HELP?

1110
01:08:27,003 --> 01:08:28,937
NO, I DON'T.

1111
01:08:28,939 --> 01:08:31,439
SHE REMEMBERS, DOC.

1112
01:08:31,441 --> 01:08:34,742
I READ TO HER      
             AND SHE REMEMBERS.

1113
01:08:34,744 --> 01:08:37,378
NOT ALWAYS,        
             BUT SHE REMEMBERS.

1114
01:08:37,380 --> 01:08:39,547
BUT SENILE DEMENTIA          
   IS IRREVERSIBLE.

1115
01:08:39,549 --> 01:08:41,316
IT'S DEGENERATIVE.

1116
01:08:41,318 --> 01:08:44,385
AFTER A CERTAIN POINT,          
ITS VICTIMS DON'T COME BACK.

1117
01:08:44,387 --> 01:08:46,287
YEAH, THAT'S WHAT     
          THEY KEEP TELLING ME.

1118
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:48,356
WELL, I JUST DON'T WANT         
YOU TO GET YOUR HOPES UP.

1119
01:08:48,358 --> 01:08:52,226
WELL, THANKS, DOC,              
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT               
THEY SAY?

1120
01:08:52,228 --> 01:08:55,863
SCIENCE GOES ONLY SO FAR        
AND THEN COMES GOD.

1121
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,498
THEN COMES GOD.

1122
01:08:59,936 --> 01:09:02,971
DAMN, I FORGOT                  
TO TURN THE PAGE FOR HER.

1123
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:25,093
I GUESS THEY FLIPPED 
           THAT PAGE.

1124
01:09:25,095 --> 01:09:28,363
NO, THAT SHE'S PLAYING          
BY MEMORY.

01:09:37,507 --> 01:09:39,940
WELL, YOUR PARENTS  
            MUST LOVE HIM.

1129
01:09:39,942 --> 01:09:44,712
HE'S A REALLY GOOD MAN, NOAH.   
YOU'D REALLY LIKE HIM.

1130
01:09:44,714 --> 01:09:46,580
YOU LOVE HIM?

1136
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:09,237

AND YOU'RE GONNA BE CARRYING    
ME RIGHT OUT OF HERE.

1142

WELL, YOU GO SLOW THEN,
         I DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO
         TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU.

YOUR PULSE LULLS       
         THE TYMPANS OF MY EARS.

EACH OTHER, DIDN'T WE?

1162
01:12:17,733 --> 01:12:18,932
I SHOULD GO.

             TOMORROW MORNING?

1165

WELL, THERE'S ONLY ONE        
  HOTEL IN SEABROOK.

1228
01:15:34,464 --> 01:15:36,497
AND WHEN YOU DIDN'T CALL,       
I GOT WORRIED.

1229

WHERE YOU BEEN?         
       ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

1299
01:24:39,408 --> 01:24:41,275
- MM-HMM.              
         - MMM...

1300
01:24:41,277 --> 01:24:42,742
( groans )

1301
01:24:42,744 --> 01:24:46,213
- HI.                    
       - YOU'RE TRYING          
         TO KILL ME, WOMAN.

1302
01:24:46,215 --> 01:24:48,748
- HUH-UH.            
           - MM-HMM.

1303
01:24:48,750 --> 01:24:50,984

            - MMM...

1304
01:24:52,588 --> 01:24:54,455
- I NEED REST.         
         - ( moans )

1305
01:24:54,457 --> 01:24:58,658
I NEED FOOD    
                 SO I CAN REGAIN
                 MY STRENGTH.

1306
01:24:59,795 --> 01:25:02,529
OKAY, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1307
01:25:05,201 --> 01:25:08,202
UMM... UMM...

1308
01:25:08,204 --> 01:25:10,204
SOME PANCAKES.

1309
01:25:10,206 --> 01:25:12,406
OKAY.

1310
01:25:12,408 --> 01:25:14,541
AND BACON.

1311
01:25:14,543 --> 01:25:17,511
- OKAY.                   
      - AND SOME CHICKEN.

1312

<i> ( car door shuts )</i>

1313
01:26:03,392 --> 01:26:05,792
SHE'S THE ONE,                  
ISN'T SHE?

1314
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:13,900
CAN I MEET HER?

1315
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:19,239
- I'D REALLY LIKE TO MEET HER.
  - I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S      
    A GOOD IDEA, MARTHA.

1316
01:26:22,711 --> 01:26:25,212
SO THIS IS MARTHA?

1317
01:26:25,214 --> 01:26:28,215
HI, I'M ALLIE.

1318
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:30,150
I'VE HEARD       
               A LOT ABOUT YOU.

1319
01:26:31,420 --> 01:26:33,387
I'VE HEARD                      
A LOT ABOUT YOU, TOO.

1320
01:26:33,389 --> 01:26:35,155
YOU WANT TO COME IN?

1321
01:26:37,526 --> 01:26:38,992
ARE YOU SURE?

1322
01:26:38,994 --> 01:26:42,229
YEAH, YEAH,                     
NOAH'S JUST SAYING              
HOW HUNGRY HE WAS.

1323
01:26:42,231 --> 01:26:44,598
AND, YOU KNOW,              
    YOU COULD PUT ON            
    A POT OF TEA.

1324
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:48,134
COME ON IN.

1325
01:26:51,373 --> 01:26:53,139
COME ON IN.

1326
01:27:02,284 --> 01:27:04,150
Allie:                         
<i> IT WAS NICE</i>                    
<i> MEETING YOU, MARTHA.</i>

1327
01:27:04,152 --> 01:27:06,453
- Martha:<i> NICE MEETING YOU TOO.</i> 
- Allie:<i> GOODBYE.</i>

1328
01:27:06,455 --> 01:27:07,954
TAKE CARE.

1329
01:27:27,009 --> 01:27:30,576
SHE'S SENSATIONAL.   
           SHE REALLY IS.

1330
01:27:31,947 --> 01:27:33,713
I'M REALLY GLAD   
              THAT I CAME, NOAH.

1331
01:27:39,187 --> 01:27:41,221
I'D FORGOTTEN       
            WHAT IT'S LIKE.

1332
01:27:45,394 --> 01:27:48,494
FOR THE FIRST TIME      
        SINCE I LOST RICHARD,

1333
01:27:48,496 --> 01:27:50,897
I FEEL LIKE             
        I'VE GOT SOMETHING      
        TO LOOK FORWARD TO.

1334
01:28:36,911 --> 01:28:38,545

LON IS ON HIS WAY HERE.

1340
01:30:13,709 --> 01:30:16,843
I'M AFRAID           
           YOUR FATHER SPILLED  
           THE BEANS ABOUT NOAH,

1341
01:30:16,845 --> 01:30:20,380
AND WHEN LON DIDN'T HEAR  
      FROM YOU AGAIN LAST NIGHT,
      HE DECIDED TO COME.

1342
01:30:20,382 --> 01:30:23,116
WELL, THAT'S GREAT.            
 THAT'S JUST TERRIFIC.

1343
01:30:23,118 --> 01:30:26,553
YOU, ME, NOAH AND LON,         
 ONE BIG HAPPY FAMILY.

1344
01:30:32,261 --> 01:30:35,128
TELL ME ABOUT                   
THE LETTERS, MOTHER.

1345
01:30:35,130 --> 01:30:37,330
- IS IT TRUE?          
         - YES.

1346
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:41,200
YOU WATCHED ME                  
CRY MYSELF TO SLEEP

1347
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:43,637
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS

1348
01:30:43,639 --> 01:30:46,139
AND YOU NEVER                   
SAID ANYTHING.

1349
01:30:46,141 --> 01:30:47,840
- HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?    
    - I'M SORRY.

1350
01:30:47,842 --> 01:30:50,277
- YOU'RE SORRY? YOU'RE SORRY?   
- YES, I AM-- I AM SORRY.

1351
01:30:50,279 --> 01:30:51,978
BECAUSE OF YOU,          
       MY ENTIRE LIFE IS RUINED!

01:30:51,980 --> 01:30:53,647
<i> OKAY, YES,</i>           
          <i> I STOLE YOUR LETTERS.</i>

1353
01:30:53,649 --> 01:30:55,315
<i> IT WAS WRONG,</i>           
       <i> BUT STOP BEING DRAMATIC</i>

1354
01:30:55,317 --> 01:30:57,216
AND AT LEAST TAKE SOME
          OF THE RESPONSIBILITY.

1355
01:30:59,421 --> 01:31:02,389
YOU CAME DOWN HERE.             
YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE DOING.

1356
01:31:02,391 --> 01:31:03,790
YOU KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN.

1357
01:31:03,792 --> 01:31:05,958
OH, SO NOW I'M A TRAMP?

1358
01:31:05,960 --> 01:31:07,727
YOU ARE UNBELIEVABLE.

1359
01:31:07,729 --> 01:31:09,763
UNBELIEVABLE.

1360
01:31:13,502 --> 01:31:16,135
GO ON AND GET                   
SOME CLOTHES ON.

1361
01:31:16,137 --> 01:31:18,271
LET'S TAKE A DRIVE.

1362
01:31:18,273 --> 01:31:21,007
LET'S TAKE A DRIVE?   
          WHY WOULD I WANT TO GO
          ANYWHERE WITH YOU?

1363
01:31:21,009 --> 01:31:24,678
BECAUSE I MIGHT KNOW YOU    
A LITTLE BETTER THAN YOU THINK.

1364
01:31:24,680 --> 01:31:27,213
AND I DON'T WANT        
   YOU WAKING UP ONE MORNING

1365
01:31:27,215 --> 01:31:28,881
THINKING THAT          
   IF YOU'D KNOWN EVERYTHING,

1366
01:31:28,883 --> 01:31:30,383
YOU MIGHT HAVE         
   DONE SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

1367

WHAT ARE WE              
       DOING HERE, MAMA?

                THAT MAN, THERE?

1369
01:31:55,377 --> 01:31:56,743
MM-HMM.

1370
01:31:59,147 --> 01:32:02,014
DON'T LOOK LIKE IT NOW,
         BUT 25 YEARS AGO--

1371
01:32:03,685 --> 01:32:06,720
OH MY GOODNESS,         
        HE WAS REALLY SOMETHING.

1372
01:32:06,722 --> 01:32:09,288
WE WERE OUT OF OUR MINDS  
      IN LOVE, LET ME TELL YOU.

1373
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,127
WOW.

1374
01:32:16,631 --> 01:32:18,998
<i> WELL, NATURALLY,</i>   
            <i> YOUR GRANDFATHER</i>   
            <i> WAS FURIOUS, SO...</i>

1375
01:32:19,000 --> 01:32:21,133
WE DECIDED     
                 TO RUN AWAY.

1376
01:32:24,272 --> 01:32:27,640
WE DIDN'T EVEN MAKE     
        THE NEXT TOWN BEFORE    
        THE POLICE PICKED US UP.

1377
01:32:30,211 --> 01:32:32,311
<i> BUT THAT WAS THEN.</i>

1378
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:37,817
YOU KNOW SOMETIMES   
           WHEN I'M IN THE AREA,

1379
01:32:37,819 --> 01:32:40,353
I JUST STOP HERE 
               AND I WATCH HIM,

1380
01:32:43,258 --> 01:32:46,959
TRYING TO PICTURE    
           HOW DIFFERENT MY LIFE
           MIGHT HAVE BEEN.

1381
01:33:00,675 --> 01:33:04,343
( sobbing )             
        I WANT YOU TO KNOW      
        THAT I LOVE YOUR FATHER.

1382
01:33:04,345 --> 01:33:06,413
- MAMA, I'M--             
      - NO, GODDAMN IT,         
        THIS IS IMPORTANT

1383
01:33:06,415 --> 01:33:08,748
AND YOU NEED       
             TO HEAR IT. I DO.

1384
01:33:08,750 --> 01:33:11,284
HE IS A WONDERFUL MAN.

1385
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:14,487
HE IS GOOD TO ME          
      AND I DON'T DESERVE HIM.

1386
01:33:14,489 --> 01:33:17,223
I LOVE HIM, ALLIE,    
          I DO, I LOVE HIM.

1387
01:33:20,562 --> 01:33:21,928
I KNOW.

1388
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:29,168
OH, GOD.

1389
01:33:29,170 --> 01:33:30,537
( sniffs )

1390
01:33:30,539 --> 01:33:33,706
OH, THIS IS JUST      
          VERY EMBARRASSING.

1391
01:33:33,708 --> 01:33:37,076
OH, I'M A STUPID WOMAN.

1392
01:33:37,078 --> 01:33:39,712
- LOOK AT ME,             
        THE BIG OLD BAWL-BAG.   
      - ( laughs )

1393
01:33:42,584 --> 01:33:44,484
IT'S CRAZY.

1394
01:33:44,486 --> 01:33:46,185
( sighs )

1395
01:33:52,126 --> 01:33:55,495
I DON'T EVEN KNOW   
            WHO THAT PERSON IS.

1396
01:34:04,172 --> 01:34:05,638
OH, BOY.

1397
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,167
OKAY.

1398
01:34:40,608 --> 01:34:42,408
( car door slams )

1399
01:34:45,079 --> 01:34:46,479
ALLIE!

1400
01:35:03,398 --> 01:35:05,030
HERE.

1401
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:12,938
I HOPE YOU MAKE       
          THE RIGHT CHOICE.

1402
01:35:39,166 --> 01:35:41,601
INTERESTING MORNING?

1403
01:35:41,603 --> 01:35:42,535
YEAH.

1404
01:35:45,039 --> 01:35:46,639
LON'S HERE IN TOWN.

1405
01:35:49,878 --> 01:35:51,577
HE'S HERE?

1406
01:35:53,615 --> 01:35:55,882
YEAH, WE SAW                    
HIS CAR ON THE WAY,

1407
01:35:55,884 --> 01:35:57,417
AT THE HOTEL.

1408
01:36:03,892 --> 01:36:04,891
HUH.

1409
01:36:07,662 --> 01:36:09,495
I SEE YOU      
                 GOT MY LETTERS.

1410
01:36:13,134 --> 01:36:14,901
FINALLY.

1411
01:36:21,876 --> 01:36:23,443
WHAT ARE YOU    
                GOING TO DO, AL?

1412
01:36:27,816 --> 01:36:29,849
I DON'T KNOW.

1413
01:36:37,024 --> 01:36:38,991
WE'RE BACK TO THAT?

1414
01:36:40,662 --> 01:36:42,194
ARE WE BACK THERE?

1415
01:36:44,131 --> 01:36:46,999
WHAT ABOUT              
        THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS?
        THEY HAPPENED, YOU KNOW?

1416
01:36:47,001 --> 01:36:49,234
I KNOW THAT THEY HAPPENED,      
AND THEY WERE WONDERFUL,

1417
01:36:49,236 --> 01:36:52,472
BUT THEY WERE ALSO              
VERY IRRESPONSIBLE.

1418
01:36:52,474 --> 01:36:54,474
I HAVE A FIANCE                 
WAITING FOR ME                  
AT A HOTEL,

1419
01:36:54,476 --> 01:36:57,276
- WHO'S GOING TO BE           
    CRUSHED WHEN HE FINDS OUT.  
  - SO YOU MAKE LOVE TO ME

1420
01:36:57,278 --> 01:36:59,579
AND THEN YOU GO BACK    
        TO YOUR HUSBAND?

1421
01:36:59,581 --> 01:37:01,447
WAS THAT YOUR PLAN?

1422
01:37:01,449 --> 01:37:03,315
WAS THAT A TEST     
            THAT I DIDN'T PASS?!

1423
01:37:03,317 --> 01:37:06,151
NO, I MADE A PROMISE            
TO A MAN, HE GAVE ME A RING     
AND I GAVE HIM MY WORD.

1424
01:37:06,153 --> 01:37:08,821
- AND YOUR WORD IS SHOT         
  TO HELL NOW, DON'T YOU THINK? 
- I DON'T-- I DON'T KNOW.

1425
01:37:08,823 --> 01:37:10,389
I'LL FIND OUT                  
 WHEN I TALK TO HIM.

1426
01:37:10,391 --> 01:37:12,424
THIS IS NOT ABOUT     
          KEEPING YOUR PROMISE,

1427
01:37:12,426 --> 01:37:15,027
AND IT'S NOT ABOUT   
           FOLLOWING YOUR HEART,

1428
01:37:15,029 --> 01:37:16,796
IT'S ABOUT SECURITY.

1429
01:37:16,798 --> 01:37:18,965
- WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?
- MONEY!

1430
01:37:18,967 --> 01:37:20,967
- WHAT ARE YOU TA--          
   - HE'S GOT A LOT OF MONEY.

1431
01:37:20,969 --> 01:37:23,068
- NOW I HATE YOU,         
        YOU SMUG BASTARD.       
      - WELL, I HATE YOU.

1432
01:37:23,070 --> 01:37:25,137
- IF YOU LEAVE HERE, I HATE YOU.
- YOU WOU--

1433
01:37:25,139 --> 01:37:27,673
- HATE YOU IF YOU LEAVE HERE.   
- HAVE YOU BEEN PAYING ATTENTION
  TO ANYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING?

1434
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:29,642
I GUESS NOT.                 
   I THINK I MUST HAVE          
   MISREAD ALL OF THOSE SIGNALS.

1435
01:37:29,644 --> 01:37:31,343
I GUESS YOU DID.

1436
01:37:34,048 --> 01:37:36,849
YOU'RE BORED.     
              YOU'RE BORED      
              AND YOU KNOW IT.

1437
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,351
YOU WOULDN'T                  
  BE HERE IF THERE              
  WASN'T SOMETHING MISSING.

1438
01:37:39,353 --> 01:37:42,021
YOU ARROGANT   
                 SON OF A BITCH!

1439
01:37:43,257 --> 01:37:45,090
WOULD YOU JUST 
                 STAY WITH ME?

1440
01:37:45,092 --> 01:37:46,959
STAY WITH YOU? 
                 WHAT FOR?

1441
01:37:46,961 --> 01:37:49,996
- LOOK AT US,               
      WE'RE ALREADY FIGHTING.   
    - WELL, THAT'S WHAT WE DO.

1442
01:37:49,998 --> 01:37:51,430
WE FIGHT.

1443
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:53,666
YOU TELL ME WHEN I'M BEING    
  AN ARROGANT SON OF A BITCH

1444
01:37:53,668 --> 01:37:56,002
AND I TELL YOU WHEN YOU'RE   
   BEING A PAIN IN THE ASS.

1445
01:37:56,004 --> 01:37:59,238
WHICH YOU ARE            
       99% OF THE TIME.

1446
01:37:59,240 --> 01:38:01,607
I'M NOT AFRAID               
   TO HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

1447
01:38:01,609 --> 01:38:03,543
THEY HAVE LIKE                 
 A TWO SECOND REBOUND RATE

1448
01:38:03,545 --> 01:38:06,846
AND YOU'RE BACK         
        DOING THE NEXT          
        PAIN-IN-THE-ASS THING.

1449
01:38:06,848 --> 01:38:10,016
- SO, WHAT?                     
- SO IT'S NOT GONNA BE EASY.    
  IT'S GONNA BE REALLY HARD.

1450
01:38:10,018 --> 01:38:12,351
AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO WORK  
       AT THIS EVERY DAY,

1451
01:38:12,353 --> 01:38:14,353
BUT I WANT TO DO THAT,     
      BECAUSE I WANT YOU.

1452
01:38:14,355 --> 01:38:17,423
I WANT ALL OF YOU,

    SOMETHING FOR ME?

1455
01:38:21,829 --> 01:38:24,797
PLEASE?                       
  WILL YOU JUST PICTURE         
  YOUR LIFE FOR ME?

1456
01:38:26,334 --> 01:38:29,903
30 YEARS FROM NOW,

    THAT GUY, GO! GO!

1458
01:38:32,640 --> 01:38:35,408
I LOST YOU ONCE,                
I THINK I COULD DO IT AGAIN,

1459
01:38:35,410 --> 01:38:37,377
IF I THOUGHT IT'S               
WHAT YOU REALLY WANTED.

1460
01:38:37,379 --> 01:38:40,013
BUT DON'T YOU TAKE           
   THE EASY WAY OUT.

1461
01:38:40,015 --> 01:38:42,248
WHAT EASY WAY?               
   THERE IS NO EASY WAY,

1462
01:38:42,250 --> 01:38:44,617
NO MATTER WHAT I DO,          
  SOMEBODY GETS HURT.

1463
01:38:44,619 --> 01:38:46,886
WOULD YOU STOP THINKING         
ABOUT WHAT EVERYONE WANTS.

1464
01:38:46,888 --> 01:38:49,588
STOP THINKING                
   ABOUT WHAT I WANT,           
   WHAT HE WANTS,

1465
01:38:49,590 --> 01:38:52,558
WHAT YOUR PARENTS WANT.       
  WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1466
01:38:54,095 --> 01:38:56,362
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?        
     - IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

1467
01:38:56,364 --> 01:38:59,565
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?     
        - IT'S NOT--

     WHAT DO YOU WANT?

1469
01:39:05,640 --> 01:39:07,473
I HAVE TO GO.

YES, IT IS.

NO, THAT WAS WALT WHITMAN.

                  ALL OF THIS?

1507
01:42:23,170 --> 01:42:27,205
I DID, WITH A LITTLE HELP       
FROM MY FRIENDS ON              
THE NURSING STAFF.

1508
01:42:27,207 --> 01:42:29,341
OH...

1509

01:43:05,179 --> 01:43:08,213
AH, SO MANY PILLS.  
            HOW SICK ARE YOU?

1514
01:43:08,215 --> 01:43:12,117
THE SICKNESS HAS BECOME         
A RELATIVE TERM FOR ME.

1515
01:43:12,119 --> 01:43:16,689
I THINK OF IT NOW             
  AS MORE A GENERAL             
  WEARING OUT PROCESS.

1516

TO YOU.

1517

<i> IN THE STORY,</i>

1519
01:43:32,406 --> 01:43:34,506
WHICH ONE DID SHE CHOOSE?

1520
01:43:38,746 --> 01:43:40,045
OKAY,

1521
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:44,916
THE WAY I SEE IT,               
I GOT THREE CHOICES.

1522
01:43:44,918 --> 01:43:46,552
ONE, I CAN SHOOT HIM.

1523
01:43:46,554 --> 01:43:50,589

  I LEAVE YOU.

1525
01:44:00,300 --> 01:44:02,501
WELL, ALL THAT'S NO GOOD.

WHEN I GAVE YOU THAT RING.

<i> I DID TOO.</i>

01:44:26,994 --> 01:44:29,661
I DID TOO.        
              IT'S JUST THAT    
              WHEN I'M--

01:44:29,663 --> 01:44:31,864
WHEN I'M WITH NOAH     
         I FEEL LIKE ONE PERSON

1535
01:44:31,866 --> 01:44:35,100
AND WHEN I'M WITH YOU 
          I FEEL LIKE SOMEONE   
          TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

1536
01:44:37,405 --> 01:44:41,139
LOOK, IT'S NORMAL     
          NOT TO FORGET YOUR    
          FIRST LOVE.

1537
01:44:49,049 --> 01:44:51,583
I LOVE YOU, ALLIE,

I DON'T WANT TO HAVE  
          TO CONVINCE MY FIANCE

01:44:56,490 --> 01:44:59,024
THAT SHE SHOULD BE    
          WITH ME.

1541
01:44:59,026 --> 01:45:02,127

YOU DON'T HAVE TO.

1542
01:45:03,330 --> 01:45:05,564
I ALREADY KNOW                  
I SHOULD BE WITH YOU.

OH YES,
