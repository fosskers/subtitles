MAN: (NARRATING) In ancient times,
the land lay covered in forests,

2
00:00:25,492 --> 00:00:30,089
where, from ages long past,
dwelt the spirits of the gods.

3
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:37,195
Back then, man and beast
lived in harmony,

4
00:00:37,304 --> 00:00:41,571
but as time went by, most
of the great forests were destroyed.

5
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,510
Those that remained were guarded
by gigantic beasts,

6
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:50,481
who owed their allegiance
to the Great Forest Spirit,

7
00:00:50,617 --> 00:00:54,485
for those were the days
of gods and demons.

- Girls!
- Ashitaka!

13
00:01:41,134 --> 00:01:43,501
There's something strange going on.
You have to hurry.

14
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,629
The wise woman wants everybody back
to the village at once.

15
00:01:45,706 --> 00:01:47,640
- We just came from Ji-san.
- Did he see something?

16
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:49,470
Yes, in the forest.
Something's wrong.

17
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:51,409
-The birds have gone.
-The animals too.

18
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:53,445
I'll go to the watchtower
and check with Ji-san.

19
00:01:53,513 --> 00:01:55,447
You three hurry back home
and be quick about it.

20
00:01:55,549 --> 00:01:57,449
All right.
Be careful!

21
00:02:18,739 --> 00:02:20,366

- Ji-san, did you see it too?
- I did. It isn't human.

25
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:50,264
The wise woman's calling everybody
back to the village.

26
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,637
There. Look.

27
00:03:21,501 --> 00:03:23,629
- It's some kind of demon!
- A demon?

28

29
00:03:44,524 --> 00:03:47,357

31
00:04:11,651 --> 00:04:14,313
It's headed for the village.
I've got to stop it.

32
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:17,290
Prince Ashitaka, wait!
Be careful!

33
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:19,588
That thing is cursed!
Don't let it touch you!

Here, Yakul!

- Kaya, don't touch it. This wound is evil.
-The prince has been hurt.

- Where is the wise woman?
- MAN: Here she comes!

You must keep away from him,
all of you. Everyone, stay back.

What shall we do?

56
00:06:39,933 --> 00:06:43,665
Take this and pour it over his wound,
child, slowly.

I bow before you.

61
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:05,956
A mound will be raised

62
00:07:06,059 --> 00:07:09,586
and funeral rites performed
on this ground where you have fallen.

63
00:07:09,729 --> 00:07:12,460
Pass on in peace
and bear us no hatred.

64
00:07:12,899 --> 00:07:15,994
Disgusting little creatures,

65
00:07:16,102 --> 00:07:19,970
soon all of you
will feel my hate

66
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:24,032

I'm afraid this is very bad.

72
00:08:04,884 --> 00:08:08,821
The stones tell me the boar god
came from far to the west.

73
00:08:08,955 --> 00:08:12,892
He had some kind of poison inside him,
driving him mad,

74
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:16,486
a poisonous hatred that consumed
his heart and flesh

75
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:19,031
and turned him
into a demon monster.

76
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,830
- Prince Ashitaka?
-Yes?

77
00:08:22,936 --> 00:08:25,564

- What's it mean?

79
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,849
My prince, are you
prepared to learn

80
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,976
what fate the stones
have foretold you?

81
00:08:41,221 --> 00:08:44,748
Yes, I was prepared
the very moment that I let my arrow fly.

82
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:51,189
The infection will spread throughout
your whole body, bone and flesh alike.

83
00:08:51,698 --> 00:08:55,999
It will cause you great pain
and then kill you.

84
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:57,968
Is there no way we can stop it?

85
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,598
The prince got that wound by defending
our village and saving our lives!

86
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,075
Do we just sit here
and watch him die?

87
00:09:04,277 --> 00:09:07,804
You cannot alter your fate,
my prince.

88
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:11,282
However, you can rise
to meet it, if you choose.

89
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,546
Look at this.

90
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,756
This iron ball was found
in the boar's body.

91
00:09:18,191 --> 00:09:20,159
This is what hurt him so.

92
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,560
It shattered his bones and
burned its way deep inside him.

93
00:09:25,732 --> 00:09:28,565
This is what tured him
into a demon.

94
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:32,730
There is evil at work in the land
to the west, Prince Ashitaka.

95
00:09:33,706 --> 00:09:35,105
It's your fate to go there

96
00:09:35,208 --> 00:09:38,109
and see what you can see
with eyes unclouded by hate.

97
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:41,141
You may find a way
to lift the curse.

-You understand?
-Yes.

99
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:47,584
We are the last of the Emishi.

100
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:51,681
It's 500 years since the Emperor
destroyed our tribe

101
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:55,250
and drove the remnants
of our people to the east.

102
00:09:55,628 --> 00:09:58,928
Some managed to survive here
for all these years,

103
00:09:59,032 --> 00:10:01,967
but the blood of our tribe
has grown thinner and weaker

104
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,127
with each generation.

105
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:08,798
Now our last prince must cut his hair
and leave us, never to return?

106
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:12,871
Sometimes I think the gods
are laughing at us.

107
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,361
Our laws forbid us
from watching you go, Ashitaka.

108
00:10:29,696 --> 00:10:33,155
Whatever comes to pass now,
you are dead to us forever.

109
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:37,295
Farewell.

You know it's forbidden.

Do you think I care about that?

113
00:11:08,101 --> 00:11:10,934
I came to give you this so you won't
forget your little sister.

114
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:17,800
Your crystal dagger.
Kaya, I can't take this.

Please, keep it with you,
brother, to protect you.

You must take it with you. Please, I want
you to have it, so you won't forget.

never forget you.

My good people,

152
00:15:05,304 --> 00:15:07,966
is there a money-changer who
could tell us how much this is worth?

153
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:10,166
No? All right.

154
00:15:10,309 --> 00:15:13,540
Now, I'm just a monk,
but I'd say three bags of rice at least.

We have got your rice,
and everything's fine.

You're a man of few words.
I understand.

Don't you even think of thanking me.
It was my pleasure.

163
00:15:32,665 --> 00:15:34,997
In fact, I should be
thanking you, really.

164
00:15:35,101 --> 00:15:38,127
You see, I was caught in that battle.
I saw what you did to those samurai.

165

You fight like a demon.
Where'd you learn to fight like that?

I see you noticed
we're being followed.

167
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:46,340
That's what we get for waving that
gold nugget around.

168
00:15:47,213 --> 00:15:50,114
They'll wait till we're asleep,
then slit our throats.

169
00:15:50,716 --> 00:15:52,480
What do you say
we give 'em a little demonstration

170
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:54,577
of how fast we can run, huh?

a few years back,

177

this was a lovely little village.

178
00:16:21,747 --> 00:16:25,342
But then there must have been
a flood or a landslide or a fire.

179

The only sure thing
is that everybody's dead.

180
00:16:30,022 --> 00:16:33,583

angry ghosts all around us,

181

sickness, starvation.

182

that the Emperor has promised

190

an entire hill of gold to anyone
who can help him live forever.

194
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:20,170
They also use stone arrowheads
just like you.

195
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:27,039
Of course, they were all
wiped out 500 years ago.

196

200
00:17:42,328 --> 00:17:44,729
It came from the giant boar.
It was inside him.

It's where the spirit of the forest dwells,

00:30:26,525 --> 00:30:29,017
Yes, is my son with you?

344
00:30:29,127 --> 00:30:30,788
I'm afraid we're the only ones
who made it.

345
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,557
(GROANS)

346
00:30:34,232 --> 00:30:36,098
It's never the guards that die.

347
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:37,565
Stand aside.

348
00:30:38,136 --> 00:30:41,299
That man in the weird costume, sir?
Who do you think it could be?

349
00:30:41,373 --> 00:30:43,273
He's obviously an outsider.

350
00:30:43,942 --> 00:30:46,001
- MAN: Be careful.
- Listen to me, everyone!

351
00:30:46,144 --> 00:30:49,546
This stranger saved our lives. He carried
the rifleman all the way back here.

352
00:30:49,614 --> 00:30:53,847
You should be grateful to him.
Ow! Hey, watch the arm.

353
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:56,945
- (WHIMPERING)
- Sir.

354
00:30:57,389 --> 00:30:59,380
(GRUNTS)
Hold it right there.

355
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:14,896
I'm very grateful to you for bringing
these men back to us, stranger,

356
00:31:15,173 --> 00:31:17,164
but something
doesn't smell right.

357
00:31:17,275 --> 00:31:21,007
You got back almost as fast as we did,
and through the forbidden forest.

358
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:23,912
On top of that, you did it
with two badly injured men,

359
00:31:24,015 --> 00:31:26,882
- and you want me to believe that you...
- Koroku! Koroku!

360
00:31:26,985 --> 00:31:29,249
-You're alive!
-Toki, my love!

361
00:31:29,654 --> 00:31:32,089
(GASPS)
- Huh?

362
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,123
That's just great!

363
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:36,091
How are you gonna drive the ox now
all banged up and mangled?

364
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:39,027
- But, my little flower...
-You scared me half to death.

365
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:42,157
Don't you "little flower" me.
1 wish the wolves had eaten you.

366
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:44,429
Then maybe I could have
found a real husband!

367
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,504
Sweetness, can we
discuss this later?

368
00:31:46,638 --> 00:31:50,404
Toki, save your sweet nothings
for some other time.

369
00:31:50,475 --> 00:31:53,570
And as for you, Gonza,
a fine captain of the guard you are,

370
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:56,943
always strutting and throwing your
weight around once the danger's over.

371
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,948
You never do a lick
of work around here.

372
00:31:59,050 --> 00:32:00,950
That's unfair and untrue.

373
00:32:01,052 --> 00:32:02,042
Thanks, stranger.

374
00:32:02,187 --> 00:32:04,519
My husband's an idiot,
but I'm glad he's safe and sound.

375
00:32:05,090 --> 00:32:06,057
That's a relief.

376
00:32:06,158 --> 00:32:08,024
I was starting to think
I'd done something wrong

377
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:09,618
by bringing him back home.

378
00:32:09,961 --> 00:32:12,123
(LAUGHING)

379
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:16,556
Say, why don't you take the mask off?
I bet you're really handsome.

380
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,600
WOMAN: Gonza?

381
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:21,069
Bring the stranger to me later.

382
00:32:21,139 --> 00:32:23,005
1 would like
to thank him personally.

383
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:26,202
- Koroku.
- Uh, yes?

384
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:30,076
- I'm happy you're back, and I apologize.
- Uh, okay.

385
00:32:30,248 --> 00:32:32,512
Uh-oh, milady, you really shouldn't
tell him things like that.

386
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,551
If you're too nice to him,
he'll walk all over you.

387
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,954
1 hope you'll forgive me, too, Toki.

388
00:32:37,088 --> 00:32:39,489
I was responsible.
1 should never have let it happen.

389
00:32:39,591 --> 00:32:42,253
Oh, that's all right.
Milady, if you hadn't been there,

390
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:43,589
the wolves would have eaten everyone,

391
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:46,461
and then we'd all have to
find ourselves new husbands.

392
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,966
Get some rest, traveler.
1 will see you this evening.

393
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,303
Oh, hey! You're not handsome,
you're gorgeous!

394
00:32:58,743 --> 00:33:01,974
(POUNDING)

395
00:33:04,649 --> 00:33:07,675
(POUNDING CONTINUES)

396
00:33:09,287 --> 00:33:12,018
- Pull!
- (GRUNTING)

397
00:33:18,096 --> 00:33:20,997
(CHATTERING)

398
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:29,004
Here! You know, they had to fight off
wolves to get this rice through.

399
00:33:29,107 --> 00:33:30,734
Just dish it out!

400
00:33:31,176 --> 00:33:33,440
- (CHATTERING)
- WOMAN 1:There he is!

401
00:33:33,612 --> 00:33:35,740
WOMAN 2: Where is he?
WOMAN 3: Over there in the back.

402
00:33:36,047 --> 00:33:38,015
Toki was right.
He is handsome.

403
00:33:38,116 --> 00:33:40,346
-Yeah, not bad.
- But he's so young!

404
00:33:40,485 --> 00:33:43,477
-That never stopped you before.
- (WOMEN LAUGHING)

405
00:33:43,655 --> 00:33:45,623
Quiet out there!
We lost some good men today.

406
00:33:45,724 --> 00:33:48,159
Yeah, there's lots of
gorgeous men in here, honey!

407
00:33:48,426 --> 00:33:50,360
I've seen cattle
that looked better.

408
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:53,192
Listen, stranger.
Why don't you come over to our place?

409
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,390
You don't want to stay
in this stinking old bam.

410
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,060
Look, woman! We risked our lives
to bring you the rice

411
00:33:58,203 --> 00:34:00,171
you're all eating tonight,
so watch your mouth.

412
00:34:00,605 --> 00:34:03,404
And who made the iron that paid
for that rice, huh? Tell me that.

413
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:05,772
Yeah, we're pumping those bellows
while you pigs are in bed.

414
00:34:06,344 --> 00:34:08,210
Actually, if it's not
too much trouble, ladies,

415
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,745
1 would like to see where you work.

416
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:12,778
-You would?
- We'll have to work in makeup tonight.

417
00:34:13,118 --> 00:34:14,779
Lend me your lipstick.

418
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:17,384
WOMAN 1: Don't be a stranger.
WOMAN 2: Don't forget now.

419
00:34:17,489 --> 00:34:19,048
WOMAN 3: We'll be waiting for you.

420
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:23,083
It's best not to pay them
any mind, you know.

421
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:26,655
Lady Eboshi spoils them rotten.
That's why they're like that.

422
00:34:26,765 --> 00:34:29,257
They say that happy women
make a happy village.

423
00:34:29,367 --> 00:34:32,735
Happy? Ha!
Those kind of women workin' here?

424
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,068
Women like that... It's a disgrace.
They defile the iron.

425
00:34:36,374 --> 00:34:38,399
Lady Eboshi goes around
buying the contract

426
00:34:38,476 --> 00:34:40,410
of every brothel girl she can find.

427
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:42,673
Milady has a kind heart,
that's all.

428
00:34:42,781 --> 00:34:44,749
You got rice
on your chin, old man.

429
00:34:44,849 --> 00:34:48,376
It's true. Everything here has turmed
upside-down since she showed up.

430
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,547
That's right. She's not even afraid
of the gods, that woman.

431
00:34:51,690 --> 00:34:54,751
You should have seen the way she dealt
with Nago. Am I right?

432
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:58,193
- Who's Nago?
- "Who's Nago?" The gigantic boar god.

433
00:34:58,296 --> 00:34:59,821
He used to rule
this whole forest.

434
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:02,691
We couldn't even get near
the mountains with him around.

435
00:35:02,801 --> 00:35:05,361
Nothing to do but sit around
on our backsides for months,

436
00:35:05,503 --> 00:35:06,664
starin' at a bunch of angry boars.

437
00:35:06,805 --> 00:35:10,298
Mmm-hmm. See, the iron in the sand
under this town had all been dug out.

438
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:12,701
Then we tried to get at the iron
under the mountain,

439
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,303
but Nago wasn't gonna stand for that.

440
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,608
The problem was,
before we could dig for the iron,

441
00:35:17,716 --> 00:35:19,616
we had to clear away the forest,

442
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:21,480
and that's what made the boar angry.

443
00:35:22,687 --> 00:35:25,486
(SCREAMING)

444
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:32,853
(SCREAMING)

445
00:35:35,567 --> 00:35:37,592
(LAUGHING)

446
00:35:37,736 --> 00:35:40,569
He's feeling no pain.

447
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:45,839
Then one day Lady Eboshi came along
with her warriors and her rifles.

448
00:35:53,785 --> 00:35:57,585
(SHRIEKING)

449
00:36:13,271 --> 00:36:15,137
Young man, what's wrong?

450
00:36:18,343 --> 00:36:20,505
Is something hurting your arm?

451
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:22,842
No, I was just thinking
about the boar god.

452
00:36:24,249 --> 00:36:26,843
1 was thinking how he must
have died filled with hate.

453
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:32,451
(HAMMERING CONTINUES)

454
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,361
Forgive me for
keeping you waiting, stranger.

455
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:38,223
That's good iron.

456
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:42,231
We were running behind
with tomorrow's shipment.

457
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:44,463
Let's have a rest.

458
00:36:44,936 --> 00:36:47,462
-You may tell the others.
-Yes, ma'am.

459
00:36:47,572 --> 00:36:49,540
Some think
you're either a spy for the Wolf Girl

460
00:36:49,641 --> 00:36:51,336
or for Lord Asano and his samurai.

461
00:36:52,444 --> 00:36:55,744
There are a lot of people out there
with their eyes on this iron.

462
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,646
Why are you here,
if you don't mind my asking?

463
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,847
I believe you'll recognize this.

464
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,190
It shattered the bones
of a giant boar,

465
00:37:09,260 --> 00:37:11,786
rotted his flesh and
turned him into a monster.

466
00:37:12,397 --> 00:37:15,958
I fought with him, and for that I was
cursed with this mark on my arm,

467
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:17,598
and soon it will kill me.

468
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:21,536
Where is it you come from?
I've never seen a red elk like that before.

469
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:25,799
I have come a very long way.
I can't tell you more than that.

470
00:37:26,845 --> 00:37:29,940
(GROWLS) Answer milady's question
or I'll cut you in half!

471
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:32,807
What do you plan to do?
What exactly are you here for?

472
00:37:34,252 --> 00:37:36,744
To see with eyes
unclouded by hate.

473
00:37:37,355 --> 00:37:40,791
"Eyes unclouded?”
(LAUGHING)

474
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:45,590
That explains it.

475
00:37:45,697 --> 00:37:47,961
Come. I'll show you all my secrets.

476
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:50,928
- Is that wise, milady?
- Gonza, take over for me.

477
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,629
On. (GRUNTS)

00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:55,526
This is my garden. None of
the townspeople dare to come here.

481
00:38:56,034 --> 00:38:59,368
Follow me if you wish
to learn my secret.

482
00:39:06,377 --> 00:39:09,403
- (CLUCKING)
- Good evening.

- (CHATTERING)
- (LAUGHING)

484
00:39:16,988 --> 00:39:19,320
WOMAN: We've only just
finished it, milady.

485
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:21,449
It's still too heavy.

486
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:23,460
Perhaps if you didn't
hold it so delicately?

487
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:26,496
Milady, if we make them
any lighter, they'll fall apart.

488
00:39:26,998 --> 00:39:28,762
1 trust you to figure it out.

489
00:39:28,933 --> 00:39:31,732
They're not for me.
They're for the other women here.

490
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,737
WOMAN:
That'll be something to see.

491
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,433
This is the latest rifle
that I've asked these people to design.

492
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,704
The ones we brought here
have turned out to be too heavy.

493
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:44,746
These will kill forest monsters and
pierce the thickest samurai armor.

494
00:39:44,916 --> 00:39:48,079
You better watch out there, young man.
Lady Eboshi wants to rule the world.

495
00:39:48,653 --> 00:39:50,747
I'm sorry to have
to push you all so hard.

496
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,722
- I'll have wine sent down later.
- Oh, that'll be nice.

497
00:39:55,460 --> 00:39:59,090
First you steal the boar's forest from him
and then transform him into a demon.

498
00:39:59,430 --> 00:40:01,023
Now you're making
even deadlier weapons!

499
00:40:01,165 --> 00:40:03,930
How much more hatred and pain
do you think we need?

500
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:07,699
Yes, I'm the one who shot the boar,
and I'm sorry that you suffer.

501
00:40:07,805 --> 00:40:09,364
I truly am.

502
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:12,899
That brainless pig. I'm the one he should
have put a curse on, not you.

01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:28,290
I have lived long enough, San.

846
01:09:28,698 --> 01:09:31,724
Soon the Forest Spirit
will let me rest forever.

847
01:09:32,201 --> 01:09:35,728
All these years you defended
the Forest Spirit! He must save you!

848
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:39,904
You are not fooling us.
Nago was beautiful and strong.

849
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:44,440
He would not have run from anything.
You wolves must have eaten him!

850
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:47,548
Quiet!
Watch what you say, you filthy pig!

851
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:50,847
ASHITAKA: Gods of the mountain,
please listen to me.

852
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:54,779
Nago died far from here,
and I was the one who killed him.

853
01:09:54,891 --> 01:09:57,155
He had become some kind of demon.

854
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,490
One day he attacked our village.

855
01:09:59,629 --> 01:10:03,566
If you want proof,
look at my hand where he touched me.

856
01:10:09,405 --> 01:10:13,364
I came here to beg the Forest Spirit
to lift Nago's curse from me.

857
01:10:14,243 --> 01:10:17,941
He healed the bullet wound in my side,
but the demon mark remains.

858
01:10:19,482 --> 01:10:23,214
First it will tear my soul apart,
and then it will kill me.

860

Okkoto, finally,
a boar who will listen to reason.

861
01:10:37,266 --> 01:10:40,463
No, Lord Okkoto, wait!
Please, you mustn't eat him.

862
01:10:40,970 --> 01:10:45,464
Ah, you are Moro's human child,
aren't you?

863
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:48,274
I have heard of you.

864
01:10:48,377 --> 01:10:49,845
(GASPS) You're blind.

865
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:53,277
Stand back. I will not eat him.

866
01:10:53,750 --> 01:10:55,479
It's all right, San.

867
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:59,452
My Lord Okkoto, what I said about
Nago's death was the truth.

869

I believe you,
and I thank you for it, young one.

870
01:11:15,872 --> 01:11:18,398
1 am only grieved and ashamed

871
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:21,535
that such a demon has come
from our tribe.

873
01:11:23,980 --> 01:11:28,349
O mighty lord, is there a way
to lift Nago's curse from me?

874
01:11:29,585 --> 01:11:31,349
Leave this forest,

875
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:34,852
for the next time we meet
1 will have to kill you.

876
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:39,585
You cannot win against the humans.
Their guns will destroy you all.

877
01:11:40,062 --> 01:11:41,928
Look on my tribe, Moro.

878
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:45,423
We grow small, and we grow stupid.

879
01:11:46,002 --> 01:11:48,835
We will soon be nothing
but squealing game

880
01:11:49,472 --> 01:11:51,634
that the humans hunt for their meat.

881
01:11:51,741 --> 01:11:54,574
You'd risk everything on one last battle?

882
01:11:54,710 --> 01:11:56,701
That's just what the humans want.

883
01:11:56,979 --> 01:11:59,949
1 do not ask for the
help of the wolf tribe.

884
01:12:00,783 --> 01:12:02,911
Even if every one of us dies,

885
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:06,683
it will be a battle
the humans will never forget.

Well, I see somebody is going to have to
go play the peacemaker.

and hide behind the cliffs.

- Where?

-The hunters are ready, sir.
- Excellent. Well done, my boy.

906

Go and spread the word.
We'll be moving out presently.

Yes, sir.

908
01:14:10,079 --> 01:14:11,513
Greetings, Jigo.

909
01:14:11,614 --> 01:14:14,481
Well, I've got the Emperor
breathing down my neck,

910
01:14:14,583 --> 01:14:16,608
and you're busy playing war
with Lord Asano.

911
01:14:16,986 --> 01:14:20,718
And you would have nothing to do with
Lord Asano being here, now, would you?

912
01:14:20,823 --> 01:14:23,451
Of course not.
Whatever made you think that?

913
01:14:23,559 --> 01:14:25,891
He'll call a truce
if I give him half my iron.

914
01:14:26,062 --> 01:14:28,463
Is that right?
Well, he's a greedy bastard, isn't he?

915
01:14:28,631 --> 01:14:31,464
But all the same,
you might as well let him have his iron.

916
01:14:31,567 --> 01:14:33,695
Listen, Eboshi,
the boars are gathering for battle.

917
01:14:33,803 --> 01:14:35,134
And you know what that means.

918
01:14:35,237 --> 01:14:36,602
You made me a promise.

919
01:14:36,706 --> 01:14:38,731
Now, once you get me the head
of the Forest Spirit,

920
01:14:38,874 --> 01:14:41,741
then we can come back
and destroy Lord Asano together, huh?

just fine from down there.

from the gods, the boars and beasts!

And now that it's worth something,
you want it!

- Well, you won't get it!
-The brazen impudence!

936
01:15:31,260 --> 01:15:33,490

taught some respect!

Do you have any idea who this paper
has come from?

01:16:17,606 --> 01:16:19,005
From the Emperor himself.

Listen, you owe me
and I've come to collect.

962
01:16:40,296 --> 01:16:41,957
When you needed riflemen, I sent them,

963
01:16:42,031 --> 01:16:44,830
and without those riflemen,
you lose Iron Town.

Oh, I'm sorry.
Did that sound like a threat?

965

head granting immortality.

and we're stuck here?

We can't help you.

than the men are.

That's precisely why I want
you all here in Iron Town.

I can deal with forest gods.
It's humans I'm worried about.

Once the Forest Spirit is dead,
we don't know what will happen.

Will Jigo be satisfied
with the creature's head

989
01:18:15,124 --> 01:18:17,388
or will he be after my ironworks as well?

990
01:18:18,260 --> 01:18:20,251
Jigo's riflemen may turn on us.

991

If that happens, I'll need
every one of you here to fight them.

1012
01:19:37,940 --> 01:19:42,309

you could always jump, boy.

1015
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:50,514
End it all.

1016
01:19:51,820 --> 01:19:56,121
As soon as your strength returns,
the mark will spread and destroy you.

1017
01:19:57,559 --> 01:20:00,358
It feels like I must
have been asleep for weeks.

1018
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,921
I had a dream that San
was by my side, nursing me.

1019
01:20:04,099 --> 01:20:06,966
1 was hoping you'd cry out in your sleep.

1020
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:10,397
Then I would have bitten
your head off to silence you.

1021
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:12,406
It's a beautiful forest.

1022
01:20:12,541 --> 01:20:14,942
Are Okkoto and the boars
on the move yet?

1023
01:20:15,110 --> 01:20:17,943
Yes, the boars are marching.

1024
01:20:18,514 --> 01:20:22,212
The trees cry out as they die,
but you cannot hear them.

1025
01:20:22,885 --> 01:20:26,344
I lie here.
I listen to the pain of the forest

1026
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:29,287
and feel the ache
of the bullet in my chest

1027
01:20:29,358 --> 01:20:32,157
and dream of the day
when I will finally crunch

1028
01:20:32,261 --> 01:20:34,389
that gun woman's head in my jaws.

1029
01:20:34,897 --> 01:20:38,299
Moro, why can't the humans
and the forest live together?

1030
01:20:38,600 --> 01:20:40,500
Why can't we stop this fighting now?

1031
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:43,401
The humans are gathering
for the final battle.

1032
01:20:43,505 --> 01:20:45,974
The flames of their guns will burn us all.

1033
01:20:46,141 --> 01:20:49,406
And what happens to San?
What's your plan, to let her die with you?

1034
01:20:50,079 --> 01:20:53,982
Typical. Selfish. You think like a human.

1035
01:20:54,249 --> 01:20:57,219
San is my daughter.
She is of the wolf tribe.

1036
01:20:57,286 --> 01:20:59,983
When the forest dies, so does she.

1037
01:21:00,155 --> 01:21:02,852
You must set her free!
She's not a wolf! She's human!

1038
01:21:03,192 --> 01:21:04,523
Silence, boy.

1039
01:21:05,027 --> 01:21:07,428
How dare you speak to a god like that.

1040
01:21:08,297 --> 01:21:11,323
I caught her human parents
defiling my forest.

1041
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:14,493
They threw their baby
at my feet as they ran away.

1042
01:21:14,636 --> 01:21:17,901
Instead of eating her,
I raised her as my own.

1043
01:21:18,040 --> 01:21:22,375
Now, my poor, ugly, beautiful daughter
is neither human nor wolf.

1044
01:21:24,580 --> 01:21:25,945
How could you help her?

1045
01:21:26,048 --> 01:21:28,915
I don't know, but at least
we might find a way to live.

1046

(LAUGHING) How?

1047
01:21:33,222 --> 01:21:36,248
Will you join forces with San
and fight the humans?

1048
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:39,424
No. All that would do
is cause more hatred.

1049
01:21:40,262 --> 01:21:42,321
There is nothing you can do, boy.

1050
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:45,196
Soon the demon mark
will spread and kill you.

1051
01:21:45,300 --> 01:21:49,635
Leave this place at sunrise.
Return and I shall kill you.

- We haven't got a lot of time.
-Those samurai bastards.

1179
01:34:46,347 --> 01:34:48,941
Asano must have just been waiting
for us to leave Iron Town.

1180
01:34:49,150 --> 01:34:51,141
Now I must find Lady Eboshi.

1181
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:53,687
She's off hunting down the Forest Spirit.

1182
01:34:54,022 --> 01:34:55,922
Then someone's got to stop her,
call her back.

1183
01:34:55,990 --> 01:34:58,288
If you're all done, I want you out of here.

1184
01:34:58,426 --> 01:35:00,053
The rest of you, keep digging!

1185
01:35:00,328 --> 01:35:03,730
- Wait! What about Iron Town?
-That's right! It's our home!

1186
01:35:03,865 --> 01:35:06,266
What do they expect us to do,
just abandon Iron Town?

1187
01:35:06,367 --> 01:35:08,358
You heard the boy!
We haven't a moment to lose.

1188
01:35:08,469 --> 01:35:12,030
- Send a message to Lady Eboshil
-The forest is too big!

1189
01:35:12,373 --> 01:35:14,137
No messenger would have
a chance of finding her!

1190
01:35:14,209 --> 01:35:17,008
Then send out a hunter!
What else are they good for?

1191
01:35:17,478 --> 01:35:20,175
Lady Eboshi is just being used by Jigo.

1192
01:35:20,481 --> 01:35:22,279
Tell me something.
When you fought with the boars,

1193
01:35:22,350 --> 01:35:24,045
were there any wolves with them?

1194
01:35:24,152 --> 01:35:26,314
Did you see San, the Wolf Girl?

1195
01:35:26,421 --> 01:35:29,914
I have no idea. It was pitch black
when the animals came at us.

1196
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:31,890
She was there. I saw her.

1197
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:35,428
I was right in the front line.
I saw everything, everything.

1198
01:35:35,763 --> 01:35:37,697
- What happened?
- I'm not sure!

1199
01:35:37,765 --> 01:35:39,324
(SOBBING) Everything started
happening so fast.

1200
01:35:39,400 --> 01:35:40,925
It was like a nightmare.

1201
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:44,767
Jigo's troops put us in front as bait
to lure the boars in.

1202
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:47,307
They didn't tell us
about the land mines under our feet

1203
01:35:47,442 --> 01:35:49,103
or the grenades coming in on top of us.

I have got to find Lady Eboshi.
This wolf's gonna help me find her.

You're on their side, aren't you, boy?

What's more important to all of you?

1220
01:37:18,266 --> 01:37:20,394
The head of the Forest Spirit
or saving your town?

After you've come through the swamp,
take cover by the lake until we get there.

Here. Take these. Where I'm going,
they won't be of any use.

You go with them, Yakul. Look after him!

Find San!
That's where we'll find Eboshi!

Straight ahead. Today we finish this.

- Sir.
-Yes? Ah, have you spotted them?

1240
01:38:44,952 --> 01:38:46,215
Okkoto's badly wounded.

1241
01:38:46,320 --> 01:38:47,947
He and the Wolf Girl
are making their way

to the realm of the Forest Spirit.

1243
01:38:50,091 --> 01:38:52,389
So they're going to beg him
for his help, are they?

1244
01:38:52,560 --> 01:38:54,585
Keep after them, but stay out of sight

1245
01:38:54,695 --> 01:38:56,663
or you'll frighten the Forest Spirit away.

Yes, sir. I understand.

02:01:31,518 --> 02:01:33,247
Now, when the sun's about to come up?

1515
02:01:33,353 --> 02:01:36,653
Look! He's a brainless,
swollen, life-sucking god of death.

1516
02:01:36,790 --> 02:01:38,884
But at sunrise he'll vanish.
Like a bad dream.

1517
02:01:39,392 --> 02:01:41,417
Sir, it's coming!
We've gotta get out of here!

1518
02:01:41,528 --> 02:01:44,725
Look, everybody wants everything.
That's the way the world is.

1519
02:01:44,831 --> 02:01:46,424
But I might actually get it.

1520
02:01:46,833 --> 02:01:48,267
Don't force me to kill you.

1521
02:01:48,701 --> 02:01:50,726
Oh, dear,
you make it sound so very easy.

1522
02:01:51,604 --> 02:01:53,572
You really ought to relax!

1523
02:01:54,674 --> 02:01:55,835
(GROWLS)

1524
02:01:55,975 --> 02:01:57,500
{BOTH GRUNTING)

1525
02:01:59,846 --> 02:02:01,905
Get going! (GRUNTING)

1526
02:02:04,751 --> 02:02:05,946
- (GROANS)
- (PANTING)

1527
02:02:08,788 --> 02:02:10,051
(WHIMPERING)

1528
02:02:14,494 --> 02:02:17,464
- (WHIMPERING)
- Oh!

1529
02:02:20,500 --> 02:02:21,729
Ashitaka!

1530
02:02:21,868 --> 02:02:23,495
1 got it! Whoa! Ooh!

1531
02:02:24,704 --> 02:02:27,867
Everything's... Oof!
Under control! Oof!

1532
02:02:29,876 --> 02:02:30,968
This is bad.

1533
02:02:33,646 --> 02:02:35,740
Master, we're surrounded!
(SCREAMS)

1534
02:02:35,982 --> 02:02:38,974
- Come on, sun! Rise!
- Open the box!

1535
02:02:39,085 --> 02:02:41,315
Don't you see? It's too late for that now!

1536
02:02:41,754 --> 02:02:43,950
Why are you wasting
your breath talking to him?

1537
02:02:44,090 --> 02:02:46,684
- Human hands must return it!
- (GROANS)

1538
02:02:49,495 --> 02:02:51,896
(GRUNTS) Don't say I didn't warn you.

1539
02:03:02,675 --> 02:03:03,733
(GASPS)

1540
02:03:04,744 --> 02:03:06,542
Forest Spirit!

1541
02:03:06,880 --> 02:03:09,474
We give you back your head!

1542
02:03:09,816 --> 02:03:12,114
Take it and be at peace!

1543
02:03:21,094 --> 02:03:24,064
Uh, well, that got his
attention, all right.

1544
02:03:36,576 --> 02:03:37,737
(GASPING)

1545
02:03:54,961 --> 02:03:56,486
Well, I think it's over.

1546
02:03:56,596 --> 02:03:57,757
- MAN: Hello!
- It's the men.

1547
02:03:57,864 --> 02:04:00,492
- (SHOUTING)
-The men! The men are back!

1548
02:04:00,934 --> 02:04:04,427
I really can't believe we made it. I never
thought I'd live to see home again.

1549
02:04:04,570 --> 02:04:05,969
(WIND HOWLING)

1550
02:04:10,877 --> 02:04:14,438
- Milady!You're here!
- Her ladyship has been injured.

1551
02:04:42,542 --> 02:04:44,738
Look! It's falling on Iron Town!

1552
02:04:50,149 --> 02:04:52,880
TOKI: Hang on tight, everybody!
Don't let go!

1553
02:05:59,986 --> 02:06:03,513
Huh? I didn't know the Forest Spirit
made the flowers grow.

1554
02:06:29,749 --> 02:06:30,910
(MOANS)

1555
02:06:33,086 --> 02:06:36,112
(GASPS) San. San, look.

1556
02:07:06,786 --> 02:07:10,086
Even if all the trees return,
it won't be his forest anymore.

1557
02:07:10,923 --> 02:07:12,891
The Great Forest Spirit is dead now.

1558
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:16,355
Never. He's life itself.
He's not dead, San.

1559
02:07:16,729 --> 02:07:19,755
He's here right now,
trying to tell us something,

1560
02:07:19,899 --> 02:07:21,867
that it's time for both of us to live.

1561
02:07:29,942 --> 02:07:31,808
Ashitaka, you mean so much to me,

1562
02:07:31,944 --> 02:07:34,276
but I can't forgive the humans
for what they've done.

1563
02:07:34,380 --> 02:07:38,317
I understand. You'll live in the forest,
and I'll go help them rebuild Iron Town.

1564
02:07:38,818 --> 02:07:42,220
I'll always be near.
Yakul and I will come and visit you

1565
02:07:42,355 --> 02:07:44,619
whenever we can, all right?

1566
02:07:55,301 --> 02:07:59,738
Amazing. The wolves and that crazy
little Wolf Girl helped save us all.

1567
02:08:00,306 --> 02:08:03,708
Ashitaka. Can someone find him?
I need to thank him.

1568
02:08:04,410 --> 02:08:08,711
We're going to start all over again.
This time we'll build a better town.

1569
02:08:09,715 --> 02:08:13,083
Well, I give up.
You can't win against fools.

1570
02:08:29,735 --> 02:08:30,964
(CLICKING)

1571
02:08:39,412 --> 02:08:43,906
In the moonlight I felt your heart

1572
02:08:44,884 --> 02:08:49,253
Quiver like a bowstring's pulse

1573
02:08:50,256 --> 02:08:53,282
In the moon's mere light

1574
02:08:53,392 --> 02:08:56,157
You looked at me

1575
02:08:56,462 --> 02:09:01,024
Nobody knows your heart

1576
02:09:02,268 --> 02:09:06,830
When the sun has gone I see you

1577
02:09:08,007 --> 02:09:12,308
Beautiful and haunting but cold

1578
02:09:13,346 --> 02:09:17,908
Like the blade of a knife
so sharp, so sweet

1579
02:09:19,919 --> 02:09:24,288
Nobody knows your heart

1580
02:09:25,391 --> 02:09:29,953
All of your sorrow, grief and pain

1581
02:09:31,330 --> 02:09:35,824
Locked away in the forest of the night

1582
02:09:36,969 --> 02:09:41,338
Your secret heart belongs to the world

1583
02:09:43,776 --> 02:09:48,145
Of the things that sigh in the dark

1584
02:09:49,248 --> 02:09:53,776
Or the things that cry in the dark
