Mmm, things are grim.

187
00:18:50,830 --> 00:18:54,698
I found two more kingdoms to the south
that have been consumed by the jungle.

188
00:18:54,867 --> 00:18:58,132
It seems as if
it spreads faster every day.

189
00:18:58,304 --> 00:19:01,865
And the kingdoms that still survive
are torn by war and starvation.

190

The cities are plagued with fear.

191
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:07,410
Why can't the other kingdoms
live happily as you do here?

192
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,742
It's because we have
the wind from the sea

cannot reach us here.

I remember it well.

by fields of gold

with the Earth that was destroyed.

And he will guide the people of this planet
at last to a land of purity.

Lord Yupa, are you searching
for the man in blue?

213

I thought that was just a myth.

214

It is a myth. Obaba is just teasing me.

Not true. That is the goal you seek.

216

The only goal I seek, Obaba,

217
00:20:23,823 --> 00:20:26,918
is to understand the mysteries
of the toxic jungle.

218
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:31,687
I want to know if mankind is truly
fated to be swallowed up by it.

Or if there is still some hope
that we may survive.

Tolmekia is far to the west,
and its rulers are very warlike.

1,000 years ago,

436

people tried time and again to burn it.

437
00:36:29,587 --> 00:36:33,717
But time and again, their attempts
did nothing but enrage the Ohm,

438
00:36:33,892 --> 00:36:36,827
and swarms of them
spilled from the jungle

439
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,187

destroyed kingdoms

they died of starvation.

445
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,516
Then spores took root in their corpses,

446
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:08,717

became part of the toxic jungle.

I must object, Your Highness.

Our orders are to transport the giant

even our largest ship
couldn't transport it.

you can't seriously want to stay here

479
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,061

480
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,993

I should deliver up that monster

I used soil drawn from there as well.

I'd like to thank you for saving me.

We're actually beneath the toxic jungle.

- Beneath the jungle?
-Yeah.

766
01:04:55,058 --> 01:04:57,322
See that?
We fell through that hole up there.

767
01:04:57,894 --> 01:04:59,293
Along with a bunch of sand.

I couldn't believe it, either.

772
01:05:09,339 --> 01:05:12,274
I never dreamed
the toxic jungle could be like this.

01:06:13,436 --> 01:06:16,030
It's dead,
but water's still flowing through it.

This is like the sand
from the bottom of our well.

779
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,484
It looks like these trees
must die and fossilize,

780
01:07:03,653 --> 01:07:05,382
and then crumble into sand.

01:07:23,806 --> 01:07:24,773

01:07:30,413 --> 01:07:31,437

Mmm. It's okay, though.

01:07:37,620 --> 01:07:38,610
I'm just happy.

785
01:07:56,439 --> 01:07:59,465

What's the origin of the jungle?

801
01:09:00,236 --> 01:09:03,137
You sure spend a lot of time
thinking about strange things.

802
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:06,507
The trees of the toxic jungle
must have evolved

803
01:09:06,676 --> 01:09:10,476
to purify the Earth of all the pollution
that we humans have made.

804
01:09:11,214 --> 01:09:14,240
The trees absorb the pollution
so it becomes inert.

805
01:09:14,484 --> 01:09:18,512
Then they die and petrify
and then crumble into purified sand.

806
01:09:18,688 --> 01:09:21,680
That's how these underground
caverns must've been formed.

807
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,856
And the insects,
they evolved to guard this place.

808
01:09:26,229 --> 01:09:29,688
If that's true, then mankind
is destined to go extinct.

809
01:09:29,866 --> 01:09:32,392
It'll take centuries
for these trees to cleanse the Earth.

810
01:09:32,568 --> 01:09:35,128
We can't survive with insects that long.

811
01:09:36,539 --> 01:09:38,633
Somehow, we are going to
have to find a way

to stop this toxic jungle from spreading.

just like the Tolmekians.

814
01:09:44,213 --> 01:09:47,774
What? We are nothing like those
bloodthirsty Tolmekians.

815
01:09:47,950 --> 01:09:49,884
We'd never use the warrior
as a weapon.

816
01:09:50,887 --> 01:09:52,753
Let's get some sleep, Asbel.

817
01:09:52,922 --> 01:09:56,187
We'll need our strength
to make it to Pejite tomorrow.

01:10:26,556 --> 01:10:28,684
The warrior's torso is almost developed.

Oh, is that a smile?

826
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:10,995
Perhaps you should remain buried
deep beneath the Earth after all.

So, is this lowly soldier
finally on the path to fame and fortune,

838
01:11:47,403 --> 01:11:49,770
or on the path to destruction?

839
01:11:58,047 --> 01:12:00,379
Lord Yupa,
Mito and the others are back.

840
01:12:00,650 --> 01:12:02,846
They're all waiting for you
at the Acid Lake.

841
01:12:11,694 --> 01:12:12,855
Down there.

842
01:12:24,073 --> 01:12:26,565
MITO: We shouldn't have returned
without the Princess.

843
01:12:26,742 --> 01:12:29,074
LORDYUPA: No, I'm glad
that all of you are safe.

844
01:12:33,816 --> 01:12:34,908
You're letting me go?

845
01:12:35,084 --> 01:12:38,816
LORDYUPA:Yes, granted that you
drown the giant warrior in the Acid Lake

846
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:40,922
and then return to your kingdom.

847
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:43,320
You have very few soldiers
left in the valley.

848
01:12:43,492 --> 01:12:45,324
We could easily defeat your forces now,

849
01:12:45,494 --> 01:12:47,792
but I see no point in further killing.

850
01:12:47,964 --> 01:12:50,058
The warrior can't be
drowned or destroyed,

851
01:12:50,433 --> 01:12:53,596
and until it walks on its own,
it can't be moved.

852
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:55,669
Don't you understand? It's too late.

853
01:12:55,838 --> 01:12:57,033
There's no turning back now.

854
01:12:57,874 --> 01:13:00,002
I was ordered to attack Pejite
because we feared

855
01:13:00,376 --> 01:13:03,038
another kingdom would
get a hold of the warrior's power.

856
01:13:03,880 --> 01:13:05,814
Once its existence is known,

857
01:13:05,982 --> 01:13:09,680
all the remaining kingdoms
will send their armies here to claim it.

858
01:13:10,953 --> 01:13:14,048
You really only have
one choice, Lord Yupa.

859
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,349
Revive the giant warrior.

860
01:13:16,525 --> 01:13:18,459
Use it to repel the invading kingdoms

861
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:20,822
and learn to live with the monster.

862
01:13:20,997 --> 01:13:21,964
Look.

863
01:13:24,166 --> 01:13:25,497
(GASPING)

864
01:13:25,735 --> 01:13:26,793
Hmm.

865
01:13:26,969 --> 01:13:28,061
An insect did that?

866
01:13:28,871 --> 01:13:31,033
That's right, and whatever
lucky man becomes my husband

867
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,875
will see worse than that.

868
01:13:33,042 --> 01:13:34,635
The insects must be stopped.

869
01:13:34,810 --> 01:13:37,905
You must revive the warrior and use it
to destroy them and their jungle.

870
01:13:39,515 --> 01:13:41,643
Steal it from us
as we stole it from Pejite.

871
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:43,751
That's what I'd do if I were you.

872
01:13:46,188 --> 01:13:49,385
No, we will keep the warrior dormant

they could use them against us instead.

we'll burn it off.

Once the insects start stampeding,
they can't be stopped.

killed off all our people.

Things may seem
bad to you now, Princess,

978
01:20:36,565 --> 01:20:39,330
but once we have the warrior, we'll burn
the jungle, and take back the Earth.

979
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:42,334
You savages!
You're just as bad as the Tolmekians!

980
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:45,405
You're wrong. The Tolmekians
want to take over the world.

981
01:20:45,574 --> 01:20:48,407
Listen, every one of us
relies on water from the wells,

982
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:51,478
because mankind has polluted
all the lakes and rivers.

983
01:20:51,847 --> 01:20:53,440
But do you know why
the well water is pure?

984
01:20:53,615 --> 01:20:55,811
The trees of the wasteland purify it.

985
01:20:55,984 --> 01:20:57,509
And you plan to burn the trees down?

986
01:20:57,886 --> 01:21:00,150
You must not burn down
the toxic jungle!

987
01:21:00,322 --> 01:21:02,552
You should have left the giant warrior
beneath the Earth!

988

So what should we do?

989
01:21:04,927 --> 01:21:06,952
Surrender and become
the slaves of the Tolmekians?

Don't you understand?

991
01:21:08,597 --> 01:21:10,429
Asbel, tell them how the jungle evolved,

992

so we won't pollute the world again.

They expect her to come back here

What?

1151
01:31:56,111 --> 01:32:00,173
I want to see if she can make it back
alive from the middle of the jungle.

It's strange that you're a princess, too.

Six months from now,
my hands will be as hard as rocks.

loves these beat-up old hands of mine.

are the hands of a hard worker.

How can you be so foolish?
The jungle is killing you,

yet you want to live in harmony with it?

1166
01:32:47,629 --> 01:32:49,222
You plan to burn down the jungle,

1167

but we've learned to use fire
only in small amounts.

1168

That's right.
Too much fire gives birth to nothing.

Ohm, thank you.

1374
01:53:10,284 --> 01:53:11,752
Thank you!

1375
01:53:31,872 --> 01:53:32,839
It's a miracle!

1376
01:53:33,106 --> 01:53:35,234
What beautiful creatures!

1377
01:53:35,876 --> 01:53:40,507
Who knew how wonderful
and caring the Ohm could be?

1378
01:53:41,915 --> 01:53:43,144
Children!

1379
01:53:43,317 --> 01:53:47,254
Look carefully and tell me
what these blind eyes cannot see.

1380
01:53:47,421 --> 01:53:50,914
The Princess is wearing a blue dress
that I've never seen before.

1381
01:53:52,326 --> 01:53:55,455
CHILD: It looks like she's walking
through a golden field.

1383
01:54:04,304 --> 01:54:06,534
After 1,000 years of darkness,

1384
01:54:06,907 --> 01:54:11,401
he will come, clad in blue and
surrounded by fields of gold!

(SOBBING)

1386
01:54:13,180 --> 01:54:14,443
What's the matter?

1387
01:54:14,614 --> 01:54:17,345
The legend has come true!

1388
01:54:19,486 --> 01:54:21,511
- Look there!

1389
01:54:22,289 --> 01:54:23,347
The glider!

1390
01:54:23,523 --> 01:54:26,515
MAN: There's wind!
WOMAN: The wind has come back!
