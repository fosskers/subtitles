I'll leave it here for you, then.

I saw her henchmen at the harbor.

I am such a big coward, all I do is hide.

640

And all of this magic
is just to keep everybody away.

I can't stand how scared I am.

642
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:36,765
Howl, why is the Witch of the Waste
trying to hunt you down?

643
00:50:37,568 --> 00:50:41,027
She was once quite beautiful,
so I decided to pursue her.

644
00:50:41,372 --> 00:50:45,275
Then I realized she wasn't.
So, as usual, I ran away.

645
00:50:48,178 --> 00:50:51,204
I can't run much longer, though.
I have to report to the palace,

646
00:50:51,382 --> 00:50:53,714

- Hmm.

- Just refuse the king's invitation.
- See that?

I entered the Royal Sorcery Academy.

He should want to hear
what all his citizens have to say.

(GASPS) I got it!
Why don't you go to the palace for me?

Huh?

662
00:51:38,395 --> 00:51:40,625
Just say
that you're Pendragon's mother,

663

and your son is such a cowardly wizard,

664

he's too afraid to show his face.

665

Maybe then Madame Suliman
will finally give up on me.

791
01:01:18,775 --> 01:01:20,937
I take it Howl won't be joining us?

792
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,178
He's such a lazy son,
he sent me instead.

793
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:28,340
I'm afraid the king would
find him completely useless.

794
01:01:29,853 --> 01:01:32,185
I am very sorry to hear that.

795
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:36,087
Howl was the last apprentice
I ever took on.

796
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:39,752
I'd never seen such a gifted student.

797
01:01:39,930 --> 01:01:42,262
I was so thrilled
to have finally found someone

798
01:01:42,432 --> 01:01:44,958
talented enough to replace me.

799
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:48,867
Then, one day,
his heart was stolen by a demon.

800
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,167
He never returned
to complete his apprenticeship.

801
01:01:51,341 --> 01:01:52,274
And from that day forward,

802
01:01:52,442 --> 01:01:56,174
he has been using his magic
for entirely selfish reasons.

803
01:01:57,914 --> 01:01:59,746
- Mrs. Pendragon.
-Yes?

804
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:01,816
That boy is extremely dangerous.

805
01:02:01,985 --> 01:02:04,784
His powers are far too great
for someone without a heart.

806
01:02:07,157 --> 01:02:08,454
If he stays selfish,

807
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:11,419
I'm afraid he'll end up
just like the Witch of the Waste.

808
01:02:11,795 --> 01:02:12,990
Send her in.

809
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,992
(GASPS)

810
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,764
What on earth happened to you?

811
01:02:21,171 --> 01:02:22,161
(HEAVY BREATHING)

812
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:25,736
I just restored her
to the age she actually is.

813
01:02:25,909 --> 01:02:27,741
All her powers are gone now.

814
01:02:28,044 --> 01:02:32,003
Once, she, too, was a magnificent
sorcerer with so much promise.

815
01:02:32,449 --> 01:02:35,282
But then she fell prey
to a demon of greed,

816
01:02:35,452 --> 01:02:38,422
who slowly consumed her,
body and soul.

817
01:02:38,788 --> 01:02:41,917
Our kingdom can no longer
afford to turn a blind eye

818
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,322
to these disreputable
witches and wizards.

819
01:02:44,494 --> 01:02:45,962
If Howl reports to me

820
01:02:46,129 --> 01:02:48,393
and vows to use his magic
to serve the kingdom,

821
01:02:48,765 --> 01:02:51,325
1 will show him
how to break from his demon.

822
01:02:51,835 --> 01:02:55,430
If not, I'll strip him of all his powers.
Just like her.

823
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,467
That is enough!

824
01:02:59,175 --> 01:03:03,043
Now I understand why Howl was
so concerned about coming to see you.

825
01:03:03,213 --> 01:03:04,271
It's a trap.

826
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:07,439
You lure people here
with an invitation from the king,

827
01:03:07,817 --> 01:03:10,309
and then you strip them
of all their powers.

828
01:03:10,487 --> 01:03:12,478
Howl would never be so heartless.

829
01:03:12,856 --> 01:03:14,790
He may be selfish and cowardly,

830
01:03:14,958 --> 01:03:16,949
and sometimes
he's hard to understand,

831
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:20,324
but his intentions are good.
He just wants to be free.

832
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,396
Howl won't come here.
He doesn't need your help.

833
01:03:23,566 --> 01:03:26,160
He can fix his problem
with his demon on his own.

834
01:03:26,336 --> 01:03:28,327
I am certain of it.

835
01:03:29,039 --> 01:03:31,838
Now I understand.
You're in love with Howl.

836
01:03:32,008 --> 01:03:35,444
- (GASPS)
- Howl? Did you say Howl's coming?

837
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:38,782
I want his heart,
his heart belongs to me! (SOBBING)

838
01:03:38,982 --> 01:03:40,950
Stop that, just calm down.

839
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,415
Howl is not coming here, okay?

840
01:03:44,120 --> 01:03:46,282
Oh, I think he will.

841
01:03:46,456 --> 01:03:50,450
I now know his weakness,
Mrs. Pendragon.

842
01:03:56,433 --> 01:03:59,130
-Your Majesty.
- As you were.

843
01:03:59,302 --> 01:04:01,031
So, then, how are you feeling?

844
01:04:01,204 --> 01:04:02,228
I'm fine, thank you.

845
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:03,839
Thought I'd drop by,

846
01:04:04,007 --> 01:04:05,941
rather than sit through
a dull war meeting.

847
01:04:06,276 --> 01:04:09,541
- What an honor.
- Who are your guests?

848
01:04:09,913 --> 01:04:12,143
This is Howl's mother, Mrs. Pendragon.

849
01:04:12,315 --> 01:04:13,339
Ah.

850
01:04:17,554 --> 01:04:18,851
Thanks for coming.

851
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:22,117
But I've decided not
to use magic to win this war.

852
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,554
We have tried using
Madame Suliman's magic

853
01:04:24,928 --> 01:04:27,192
to shield our palace
from the enemy's bombs.

854
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:29,957
But the bombs fall
on civilian homes instead.

855
01:04:30,133 --> 01:04:32,864
That's the problem with magic.
Right, Suliman?

856
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:35,004
You're so eloquent today, Your Majesty.

857
01:04:35,271 --> 01:04:36,932
Suliman!

858
01:04:37,207 --> 01:04:38,333
(GASPS)

859
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:41,135
I've got a new battle plan.

860
01:04:41,311 --> 01:04:43,575
This time we're going
to beat them to a pulp.

861
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:46,416
Um... (LAUGHING)

862
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,146
Suliman, that's the best double
you've made of me yet.

863
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:51,014
Ha! Keep up the good work.

864
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,154
Your Majesty.

865
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,091
- Get my generals assembled.
- Sir.

866
01:04:58,395 --> 01:05:01,330
So nice to see you again, Howl.

867

I kept my oath,
I reported when summoned.

871
01:05:10,974 --> 01:05:12,442
Now Mother and I will go.

872
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:14,441

you work for Suliman.

come here if you were coming yourself?
