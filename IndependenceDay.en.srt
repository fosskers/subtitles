1
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:08,728
For those who haven't read the plaque,

2
00:01:08,802 --> 00:01:10,793
we'll read the plaque.

3
00:01:11,572 --> 00:01:13,563
“Here men from the planet Earth

4
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:15,631
first set foot upon the moon,

5
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:18,401
July 1969."

6
00:01:19,813 --> 00:01:22,111
"We came in peace for all mankind."

7
00:03:01,948 --> 00:03:06,351
If this isn't an insanely beautiful woman,
I'm hanging up.

8
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:08,821
Sir, I think you should listen to this.

9
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,921
- Sir?
- Goddamn it!

10
00:03:18,999 --> 00:03:20,228
Sir?

11
00:03:21,368 --> 00:03:23,598
Come on, baby, come on, baby, come on!

12
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,799
This better not be
another damn Russian spy job!

13
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:29,137
Boys at air traffic say the skies are clear.

14
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,143
It's the real thing.

15
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,269
A radio signal from another world.

16
00:03:33,346 --> 00:03:34,836
Let's not jump the gun here.

17
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:38,146
Get online with Space Command.
They're gonna want to know...

18
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,848
What's with the golf balls?
You're gonna kill me here!

19
00:03:41,922 --> 00:03:43,913
Wait, this can't be right.

20
00:03:43,990 --> 00:03:49,019
The calculated distance from source
is only 375,000km.

21
00:03:51,765 --> 00:03:53,756
It's coming from the moon.

22
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:08,571
Who else knows about this?

23
00:04:08,648 --> 00:04:10,980
SETI in New Mexico identified a signal.

24
00:04:11,051 --> 00:04:14,885
But, uh...
they're even more confused than we are, sir.

25
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:17,483
Excuse me.

26
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,952
- Major!
- Yes, sir.

27
00:04:23,029 --> 00:04:25,020
Radar reception has been impaired,

28
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:27,123
but we were able to get these.

29
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,537
We estimate that it has
a diameter of over 550km

30
00:04:31,605 --> 00:04:35,269
and a mass roughly one fourth
the size of our moon.

31
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,333
What the hell is it?

32
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:39,401
- A meteor?
- No, sir.

33
00:04:39,546 --> 00:04:42,208
- No, definitely not.
- How do you know?

34
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:44,614
Well, sir, it's slowing down.

35
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:46,846
- It's what?
- It's, uh...

36
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,287
It's slowing down, sir.

37
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,328
Get me the Secretary of Defense.

38
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:01,427
Then wake him!

39
00:05:05,305 --> 00:05:06,773
- Hello.
- Hi.

40
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,468
- It's me.
- Hi.

41
00:05:09,543 --> 00:05:11,341
What time is it there?

42
00:05:11,411 --> 00:05:13,641
It's 2.45 in the morning.

43
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:16,739
- I know I didn't wake you.
- As a matter of fact you did.

44
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,615
Liar.

45
00:05:20,654 --> 00:05:22,645
I have a confession to make.

46
00:05:22,722 --> 00:05:26,352
I'm sleeping next to
a beautiful, young brunette.

47
00:05:26,927 --> 00:05:29,624
You didn't let her stay up
all night watching TV?

48
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:32,791
- Did you?
- Of course not.

49
00:05:32,866 --> 00:05:35,665
- You're coming home after the luncheon?
- Yes, yes.

50
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:37,726
- Mommy?
- Here's your mother.

51
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:44,334
- Hi, honey!
- Hi, I miss you.

52
00:05:44,411 --> 00:05:49,577
President Whitmore's approval ratings
have slipped below 40%.

53
00:05:49,649 --> 00:05:51,310
He's good.

54
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:55,082
Are the salad days over
for President Whitmore?

55
00:05:55,155 --> 00:05:59,114
Leadership as a Gulf War pilot
is different from leadership in politics.

56
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:01,126
Daddy let me watch Letterman.

57
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,424
Traitor.

58
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:06,158
The problem is
they elected a warrior and got a wimp.

59
00:06:06,233 --> 00:06:09,396
- Morning, George.
- Morning, Mr President.

60
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:12,362
That game couldn't have been pretty.

61
00:06:12,439 --> 00:06:14,430
Thank you, sir.

62
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,108
Connie, you're up awfully early this morning.

63
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,948
They're not attacking your policies,
they're attacking your age.

64
00:06:23,016 --> 00:06:26,975
"Addressing Congress,
Whitmore seems less like the President

65
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:29,613
and more like the orphaned child Oliver

66
00:06:29,689 --> 00:06:32,454
asking, 'Please, sir, I'd like some more."

67
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:35,153
- That's clever.
- Well, I'm not laughing.

68
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,864
Age was never an issue
when you stuck to your guns.

69
00:06:37,931 --> 00:06:40,195
You were thought of as young, idealistic...

70
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:42,998
Now... the message has gotten lost.

71
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:46,198
It's just too much politics.
It's too much compromise.

72
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:50,574
Isn't it amazing how quickly
everyone can turn against you?

73
00:06:52,279 --> 00:06:54,839
Mr President, it's the Secretary of Defense.

74
00:06:57,951 --> 00:06:59,942
Yes?

75
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,514
Could... you say that again?

76
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:40,588
Temperature is 95° in Central Park...

77
00:07:42,595 --> 00:07:46,725
Let's go to Nick Jones
and get us a travel report for the beaches...

78
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,791
So why are you waiting, hm?

79
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:52,168
My Social Security will expire,
you'll still be sitting there.

80
00:07:53,173 --> 00:07:56,074
- I'm thinking.
- Yeah, well, think already!

81
00:08:03,817 --> 00:08:06,878
Do you know how long it takes
for those cups to decompose?

82
00:08:06,953 --> 00:08:09,479
If you don't move soon,
I'll start to decompose.

83
00:08:14,828 --> 00:08:17,798
Listen, David,
I've been meaning to talk with you.

84
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:23,060
- It's nice that you see me so much now...
- Don't start, Dad.

85
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:27,004
It's been... what? Four years?
You're still wearing a wedding band?

86
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:29,667
- Three years.
- All right, three... four.

87
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:32,110
You're divorced, move on. This is not healthy.

88
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:35,478
No, this is not healthy.
The smoking is not healthy.

89
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:42,288
- Checkmate.
- Wait a minute.

90
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:44,289
Wait a minute, wait a minute.

91
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:47,850
- Wait a minute. This is not checkmate.
- See you tomorrow, Pop.

92
00:08:47,927 --> 00:08:50,487
Just hold on! This is not checkmate.

93
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,534
We've got everybody we have
working on the problem.

94
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,665
I love X-Files, too. I hope you get to see it.

95
00:09:02,342 --> 00:09:04,003
David! David!

96
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:07,047
What's the point in having a beeper
if you don't turn it on?

97
00:09:07,113 --> 00:09:09,138
It was turned on. I was ignoring you.

98
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:11,684
What's the... What's the big emergency?

99
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:15,585
It started this morning.
Every station's making like it's the 1950s.

100
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,215
We got static, snow, all kinds of distortions.

101
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,282
- Marty.
- Nobody knows...

102
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,954
There's a reason we have bins
labeled "Recycle"!

103
00:09:23,029 --> 00:09:25,464
What the hell is going on? My God in heaven!

104
00:09:25,532 --> 00:09:28,695
So sue me. David! We got a problem!

105
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,032
Did you switch transponder channels?

106
00:09:31,104 --> 00:09:34,301
Oh, please! You think I'd be this panicked
if it was so simple?

107
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,900
OK, let's point the dish at another satellite.

108
00:09:36,976 --> 00:09:39,673
We tried that. It didn't work.

109
00:09:39,746 --> 00:09:42,044
It's almost as though they weren't there.

110
00:09:42,115 --> 00:09:44,413
All right. What have we got here?

111
00:09:50,056 --> 00:09:52,047
This is impossible.

112
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:52,158
We created a race of robots.
Their function is to...

113
00:09:52,158 --> 00:09:55,059
We created a race of robots.
Their function is to...

114
00:09:55,128 --> 00:09:57,995
The signal's all screwed up.

115
00:09:58,064 --> 00:10:00,556
Stop it! Leave it alone. You'll break it!

116
00:10:00,633 --> 00:10:02,931
Oh, it's so fuzzy.

117
00:10:09,776 --> 00:10:11,266
Oh, no.

118
00:10:15,949 --> 00:10:17,940
Good morning, Lucas.

119
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:22,011
You see these?
I got a whole goddamn crop full of these.

120
00:10:22,088 --> 00:10:24,955
If your father's not in the air in 20 minutes,

121
00:10:25,024 --> 00:10:27,015
I'm getting someone else.

122
00:10:36,102 --> 00:10:39,163
- Russell!
- Hey, Miguel!

123
00:10:52,385 --> 00:10:55,218
Russell! What are you doing?

124
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:12,836
Just what in the hell
do you think you're doing?

125
00:11:16,876 --> 00:11:18,935
It's the wrong field, you idiot!

126
00:11:19,012 --> 00:11:21,344
Lucas's farm's on the other side of town!

127
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,975
Are you sure?

128
00:12:05,225 --> 00:12:09,093
CNS is running a story that we're covering up
a nuclear-testing experiment.

129
00:12:09,162 --> 00:12:12,154
They can run with it
if they want to embarrass themselves.

130
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,223
NASA wants to know our position.

131
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,291
Our official position is

132
00:12:16,369 --> 00:12:18,360
we have no official position.

133
00:12:18,438 --> 00:12:20,429
- Connie!
- What is going on here?

134
00:12:20,506 --> 00:12:22,531
Guys, would I keep you out of the loop?

135
00:12:22,609 --> 00:12:24,168
- Yes.
- Absolutely.

136
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:26,042
What? I can't hear you.

137
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,207
At the moment
our satellites are somewhat unreliable.

138
00:12:29,282 --> 00:12:32,252
Isn't it possible
that this thing may just pass us by?

139
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:34,309
What if it doesn't pass us by?

140
00:12:34,387 --> 00:12:36,879
Why don't we target some ICBMs
to blow it up?

141
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:39,618
And risk turning
one dangerous falling object into many?

142
00:12:39,692 --> 00:12:43,686
We don't yet know enough
to make any kind of intelligent judgments.

143
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:46,892
Luckily the press is making up
their own story for now.

144
00:12:46,966 --> 00:12:48,957
But that's not gonna keep.

145
00:12:49,035 --> 00:12:52,266
- We may need to upgrade to DEFCON 3.
- Absolutely.

146
00:12:52,338 --> 00:12:57,037
- General, tell NORAD we're on DEFCON 3.
- That's not what the President said.

147
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,078
Isn't that a little premature?

148
00:12:59,145 --> 00:13:01,807
We have over 50% of the armed forces
on weekend leave.

149
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,749
Plus the commanders and troops
that are in town for the Fourth of July parade.

150
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,914
Our intelligence tells us
the object has settled into a stationary orbit.

151
00:13:09,989 --> 00:13:12,424
- Well, that's good news.
- Not really, sir.

152
00:13:12,492 --> 00:13:15,462
Part of it has broken off
into nearly three dozen pieces.

153
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:18,293
Smaller than the whole, sir,

154
00:13:18,364 --> 00:13:20,992
yet over 15 miles in width themselves.

155
00:13:23,603 --> 00:13:25,731
Where are they heading?

156
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:29,173
They should enter our atmosphere
within the next 25 minutes.

157
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,167
- This had better be good.
- Admiral on deck!

158
00:14:05,211 --> 00:14:09,341
Sir, we're looking at a total radar blackout
over a 13km area.

159
00:14:09,415 --> 00:14:12,112
- Let's do a diagnostic check.
- Excuse me, sir.

160
00:14:12,185 --> 00:14:16,179
The radar may be malfunctioning,
but the infrared is totally off the map.

161
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,384
Jeez!

162
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:26,158
Get me Atlantic Command on the line.

163
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:34,340
Sir, we have visual range with incoming
over Iraqi air space.

164
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:38,207
- Second sighting?
- Yes, sir. Just came in from the Persian Gulf.

165
00:14:38,644 --> 00:14:39,975
Correction, sir.

166
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,105
We have two confirmed visual contacts.

167
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:46,084
Mr President, they're tracking another one
off the California coastline!

168
00:14:46,152 --> 00:14:48,143
All right, go ahead, put it on.

169
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:50,622
General, you might wanna watch this.

170
00:14:53,259 --> 00:14:57,662
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are interrupting our regular broadcast

171
00:14:57,730 --> 00:15:01,462
to bring you extraordinary events
taking place in the Russian Republic.

172
00:15:01,534 --> 00:15:05,562
This unexplained disturbance
and the resulting hysteria are incredible.

173
00:15:05,638 --> 00:15:08,699
How would you describe
what you are seeing?

174
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:11,836
It is clearing the mountains,
moving too slowly

175
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:14,175
to be a comet or meteor.

176
00:15:14,247 --> 00:15:17,842
Widespread panic
has gripped the countryside

177
00:15:17,950 --> 00:15:21,215
as thousands have taken to the streets.

178
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:25,087
It is confirmed. The unexplained
phenomenon is headed for Moscow.

179
00:15:25,158 --> 00:15:27,593
Mr President,
we have an AWAC off the West Coast.

180
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:31,028
ETA with contact point, three minutes.

181
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:35,128
Don't understand it, sir.
Side radar doesn't see a thing.

182
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:38,432
I know! I'm blind, sir.
Nothing is registering.

183
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:41,599
Negative.
We have zero visibility. Visibility is at zero.

184
00:15:41,674 --> 00:15:44,439
Command, this is Eagle Eye 370.

185
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:49,675
Captain, the President is listening.
Repeat what you just told me.

186
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:53,520
We still have zero visibility.

187
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:57,521
Instrumentation is malfunctioning.

188
00:15:57,590 --> 00:16:00,355
We can't get any reading
on what's in front of us.

189
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,258
Wait a minute.

190
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:05,591
It may be clearing.

191
00:16:13,673 --> 00:16:15,437
Pull out!

192
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:28,782
- Line's gone, sir.
- Two more spotted over the Atlantic.

193
00:16:28,855 --> 00:16:31,222
One's moving toward New York,
the other here.

194
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,418
- How long do we have?
- Less than 10 minutes.

195
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,484
Alex, organize a military escort.

196
00:16:35,561 --> 00:16:39,429
Mr President, I strongly recommend
we move you to a secure location.

197
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:42,799
- Connie, can we expect panic, too?
- More than likely.

198
00:16:42,869 --> 00:16:45,861
- We can discuss this on the way.
- I'm not leaving.

199
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:49,969
We have to maintain a working government.

200
00:16:50,042 --> 00:16:54,479
Take the Vice President, the whole cabinet,
and the Joint Chiefs to a secured location.

201
00:16:54,547 --> 00:16:56,072
I'm staying.

202
00:16:56,148 --> 00:16:59,846
I don't want to add
to a public hysteria that's gonna cost lives.

203
00:16:59,919 --> 00:17:03,583
Connie, we'll initiate
the emergency broadcast system.

204
00:17:03,656 --> 00:17:05,647
We'll advise people not to panic.

205
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:09,093
The best idea right now
is to stay in their homes.

206
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,152
Yes, sir. Roy? Dean?

207
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:14,860
Have the cabinet members rendezvous here,
we'll take them to NORAD.

208
00:17:14,934 --> 00:17:19,030
Mr President, with your permission,
I'd like to remain at your side.

209
00:17:21,340 --> 00:17:23,331
I had a feeling you would.

210
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:28,570
And what happens if they do become hostile?

211
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,878
Then God help us.

212
00:17:32,952 --> 00:17:32,985
There itis.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.

213
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,613
There itis.
The strange atmospheric phenomenon.

214
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:38,749
It is apparently what is causing
all the distortions...

215
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:40,952
David, are you watching this?

216
00:17:46,065 --> 00:17:50,434
There is no evidence that these phenomena
are endangering anyone.

217
00:17:50,503 --> 00:17:52,665
Thus far, reports of oppression...

218
00:17:52,738 --> 00:17:57,403
Marty, listen to this. I got a lock on
that signal pattern so we can filter it out.

219
00:17:57,476 --> 00:18:01,003
But if my calculations are right
it'll be gone in seven hours.

220
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:04,243
It's reducing itself every time it recycles,

221
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,752
so eventually it'll disappear...

222
00:18:06,819 --> 00:18:09,254
- Are you listening?
- Can you believe this?

223
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:14,551
Damn it!
Haven't you been watching? David!

224
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:21,326
Good afternoon. So far the phenomenon
has not caused any damage.

225
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:25,530
We have to ask you to stay calm,
and it's important for everyone not to panic.

226
00:18:25,605 --> 00:18:29,098
We have a fix on three
of the occurrences about to appear...

227
00:18:29,175 --> 00:18:32,201
- It's just unreal.
- Hey, Miguel, come here!

228
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:34,872
One is headed towards Los Angeles,

229
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:39,714
the other two are headed towards New York
and Washington, DC.

230
00:18:39,785 --> 00:18:40,684
Marty.

231
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,519
Marty! Jamie says this building
has an old bomb shelter.

232
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,581
We're heading down there now.

233
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:49,128
OK, everybody! Head down to the basement.

234
00:18:49,195 --> 00:18:51,186
Take it slow, don't run.

235
00:18:51,263 --> 00:18:53,254
Walk down to the basement!

236
00:18:54,734 --> 00:18:56,725
There's no shame in hiding.

237
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:59,362
Oh, I'd better call my mother.

238
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:13,747
Well, look who we have here.

239
00:19:16,822 --> 00:19:19,621
Russ, I heard you had
a little trouble this morning.

240
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:21,683
Dusted the wrong field.

241
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:27,325
I know you're probably still a little confused
from your hostage experience.

242
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,391
Hostage experience?

243
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:31,459
Did something happen to you, Russ?

244
00:19:31,537 --> 00:19:36,441
Six years back, he was kidnapped by aliens.
Did all kind of experiments on him and such.

245
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,443
Tell ‘em about it, Russ.

246
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:41,003
Get a few beers in him
and he'll tell you about it.

247
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,071
Won't you, Russ?

248
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:47,711
Russ, when they took you up
in their spaceship, did they do any...

249
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:49,755
sexual things?

250
00:19:49,822 --> 00:19:52,723
Do you recall? Do you recollect?

251
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:24,155
- What's that?
- Let's get outta here, come on!

252
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,320
Wow!

253
00:20:49,448 --> 00:20:50,779
Mommy, look it!

254
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:56,646
It's too early, baby.

255
00:21:02,661 --> 00:21:04,652
Is it an earthquake?

256
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,721
Not even a four-pointer.

257
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,790
Go back to sleep.

258
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,074
Daddy!

259
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:29,944
What are you doing here?

260
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:33,424
- You should be down in the shelter.
- What's going on?

261
00:22:06,959 --> 00:22:09,428
- Aren't you coming, David?
- I gotta see this.

262
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:32,140
Oh, man! What is that?

263
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,605
The signal!

264
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:41,542
My God!

265
00:23:57,770 --> 00:23:59,898
Now what do we do?

266
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:02,134
Address the nation.

267
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,370
There's gonna be
a lot of frightened people out there.

268
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:07,003
Yeah.

269
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:09,070
I'm one of ‘em.

270
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:13,775
Hey, hey, hey! Come on!

271
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:15,980
He's just trying to impress you.

272
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:18,947
If you wanna impress me,
you need to get a job

273
00:24:19,024 --> 00:24:21,220
and stop slobberin' all over my shoe.

274
00:24:35,975 --> 00:24:37,807
I don't believe this.

275
00:24:37,876 --> 00:24:39,708
Jasmine!

276
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,840
Neighbors are movin' out. I guess
they finally got tired of all these quakes.

277
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,249
A little shake and they runnin'.

278
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:52,255
Police and fire departments
want everyone to stay off the phone.

279
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,918
There's something on the news
about the quake!

280
00:24:57,629 --> 00:24:59,290
- What's up, man?
- Hey, Steve.

281
00:24:59,365 --> 00:25:03,302
- What you been doin' out there?
- Shooting aliens.

282
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:06,134
Oh, you shootin' aliens.
You think you're tough, huh?

283
00:25:06,205 --> 00:25:08,196
What you got? Turn around.

284
00:25:08,273 --> 00:25:10,674
Come on, let's get you something to eat.

285
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,168
Watch out! Watch it now!

286
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,715
- I'm gonna go grab the paper.
- All right.

287
00:25:18,183 --> 00:25:20,345
Ow! Dylan!

288
00:25:33,565 --> 00:25:35,556
All right, honey, let's go!

289
00:25:51,150 --> 00:25:54,120
Babe! You want some of this coffee?

290
00:25:54,186 --> 00:25:56,348
Babe?

291
00:25:58,290 --> 00:25:59,689
Boom! Boom! Boom!

292
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,354
Pentagon officials are warning
more ships have just arrived

293
00:26:06,432 --> 00:26:09,891
over the capitals
of India, England, and Germany,

294
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,734
bringing estimates up to between 10 and 15
of these city-size spacecraft.

295
00:26:13,806 --> 00:26:16,138
I know, Ma. Just try and stay calm!

296
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,900
Tell her to pack up and leave town.

297
00:26:18,977 --> 00:26:20,968
- Why? What happened?
- Just do it!

298
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:23,037
Ma! Ma, listen!

299
00:26:23,115 --> 00:26:26,050
Get your stuff together
and head for Aunt Esther's.

300
00:26:26,118 --> 00:26:28,109
Don't argue with me! Just go!

301
00:26:28,854 --> 00:26:31,915
David! Why did I just
send my mother to Atlanta?

302
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,981
David! David, talk to me.

303
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:37,324
Didn't you hear me say that
the signal hidden in the satellite feed

304
00:26:37,396 --> 00:26:39,194
is recycling down to extinction?

305
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,255
- Not really.
- Countdown.

306
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:44,667
A countdown? A countdown to what, David?

307
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:50,333
It's like in chess.
First you strategically position your pieces.

308
00:26:50,409 --> 00:26:54,175
Then, when the timing's right,
you strike. See?

309
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,011
They're positioning themselves
all over the world,

310
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,744
using this one signal
to synchronize their efforts.

311
00:26:59,818 --> 00:27:04,016
In about six hours, the signal's gonna
disappear and the countdown will be over.

312
00:27:04,089 --> 00:27:05,648
And then what?

313
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:09,717
Checkmate.

314
00:27:11,029 --> 00:27:14,124
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

315
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,190
Oh, my God, I gotta call my brother.

316
00:27:16,268 --> 00:27:19,203
I'd better call my housekeeper.
I gotta call my lawyer!

317
00:27:19,271 --> 00:27:21,262
Ah, forget my lawyer.

318
00:27:21,340 --> 00:27:24,742
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

319
00:27:24,810 --> 00:27:26,642
Good afternoon.

320
00:27:26,712 --> 00:27:28,703
My fellow Americans,

321
00:27:28,780 --> 00:27:32,216
a historic and unprecedented event
has occurred.

322
00:27:32,284 --> 00:27:35,276
The question of whether or not
we're alone in the universe

323
00:27:35,354 --> 00:27:37,345
has been answered.

324
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:41,791
Although it's understandable
that many of us feel hesitation or fear

325
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:44,591
we must attempt to reserve judgment.

326
00:27:44,663 --> 00:27:46,825
He says he's your husband.

327
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:50,391
Oh, God.

328
00:27:51,370 --> 00:27:53,338
What do you want?

329
00:27:53,405 --> 00:27:55,430
You gotta leave the White House.

330
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:58,943
This is hardly the time
to be having that same old discussion.

331
00:27:59,011 --> 00:28:00,570
You gotta leave Washington.

332
00:28:00,646 --> 00:28:04,310
In case you haven't noticed,
we are having a little crisis here!

333
00:28:04,383 --> 00:28:07,148
They have a hidden signal.
They're gonna attack.

334
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:09,745
- You are just being paranoid!
- It's not paranoia!

335
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:13,018
The embedding's very subtle.
It was probably overlooked...

336
00:28:20,599 --> 00:28:23,796
Marty, what are you doing?
Get out of town as soon as you can.

337
00:28:23,869 --> 00:28:25,496
- Please?
- OK.

338
00:28:25,571 --> 00:28:28,700
The staff and I will remain here
as we attempt to communicate.

339
00:28:28,774 --> 00:28:32,369
If you feel compelled to leave these cities,

340
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,243
please do so in an orderly fashion.

341
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,781
Excuse me! Coming through.

342
00:28:46,792 --> 00:28:46,825
The arrival of the alien visitors has caused

343
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,192
The arrival of the alien visitors has caused

344
00:28:49,261 --> 00:28:51,923
over 10,000 fender benders
in just a few seconds.

345
00:28:51,997 --> 00:28:53,988
But this is just the beginning.

346
00:28:54,766 --> 00:28:59,499
- You can't go! You got to call them back!
- I'm not gonna do this with you, Jasmine.

347
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:03,132
- I've got to report to El Toro.
- You said you was on leave for the Fourth!

348
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:05,609
Yeah, well, they canceled it!

349
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,036
Look, why are you acting like this?

350
00:29:10,015 --> 00:29:11,505
Why?

351
00:29:14,553 --> 00:29:16,544
That's why!

352
00:29:25,797 --> 00:29:27,925
Look, I really don't think

353
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:31,300
they flew 90 billion light years
to come here and start a fight

354
00:29:32,204 --> 00:29:34,195
and get all rowdy.

355
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,401
Look, why don't you just relax?

356
00:29:36,475 --> 00:29:40,139
I'm gonna report to El Toro,
find out what's goin' on.

357
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:47,776
- What are you doin' in there, man?
- Nothing, I'm just drivin'.

358
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:49,446
Look.

359
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:51,353
Hey, I got these for you.

360
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,255
- Firecrackers!
- You be careful.

361
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,724
Steve, wait.

362
00:29:54,793 --> 00:29:58,161
- I wanna tell you something.
- What is it, Jasmine?

363
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,764
You take care of yourself, you hear?

364
00:30:06,972 --> 00:30:08,633
Look, um...

365
00:30:08,707 --> 00:30:12,905
Why don't you pack some things and you
and Dylan come stay with me on the base?

366
00:30:14,713 --> 00:30:17,774
You will see that there is nothing
to be scared of.

367
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:19,783
Really?

368
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:21,819
You don't mind?

369
00:30:21,887 --> 00:30:23,878
Well, I mean...

370
00:30:23,955 --> 00:30:26,720
I will have to let all my other girlfriends know

371
00:30:26,792 --> 00:30:29,887
they can't come over.
I got to postpone a freaky weekend.

372
00:30:29,961 --> 00:30:33,329
There you go, there he goes,
thinking you're all that.

373
00:30:33,398 --> 00:30:36,834
But you are not as charming
as you think you are, sir.

374
00:30:36,902 --> 00:30:38,927
Yes, I am.

375
00:30:39,004 --> 00:30:41,371
Them big old Dumbo ears.

376
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,670
Look at you with them chicken legs.

377
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:54,041
Come on, Dylan.

378
00:31:09,668 --> 00:31:12,638
The television said they started looting.
Vultures.

379
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:15,867
- Do you still have the Plymouth?
- You wanna borrow the car?

380
00:31:15,941 --> 00:31:18,774
- David, you don't have a license.
- You're driving.

381
00:31:18,844 --> 00:31:21,814
- Yeah, I'm driv... I'm driving?
- Come on, come on!

382
00:31:23,682 --> 00:31:26,151
I really want you out of Los Angeles.

383
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:28,744
You're staying there to keep people calm.

384
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,118
I won't let them criticize you for it.

385
00:31:31,189 --> 00:31:36,025
- I appreciate your trying to help me.
- Liar. Stick to the truth. You're good at it.

386
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:38,586
OK. I don't want you
in any one of those cities.

387
00:31:39,564 --> 00:31:42,192
I'll leave as soon as the interviews are done.

388
00:31:42,267 --> 00:31:46,226
All right. There's a helicopter waiting.
They're taking you to Nullius.

389
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:48,739
- And the munchkin?
- She'll meet you there.

390
00:31:48,807 --> 00:31:51,833
All right. I love you.

391
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:53,708
I love you.

392
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,074
- Bye.
- Bye.

393
00:32:00,986 --> 00:32:03,318
It's the White House, for crying out loud!

394
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,551
- You can't drive up and ring a bell.
- Can't this go any faster?

395
00:32:06,625 --> 00:32:10,823
You think they don't know what you know?
They know! She works for the President.

396
00:32:10,896 --> 00:32:13,558
- They know everything.
- They don't know this.

397
00:32:13,632 --> 00:32:16,932
You're gonna educate them, huh?
So tell me. Are you so smart?

398
00:32:17,002 --> 00:32:20,438
How come you spent eight years
in MIT to become a cable repairman?

399
00:32:20,505 --> 00:32:23,497
All I'm saying is they got people
who handle these things.

400
00:32:23,575 --> 00:32:25,543
If they want HBO, they'll call you.

401
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,238
Look at these people, look. Huh?

402
00:32:28,313 --> 00:32:30,441
Vultures. They take and then they go.

403
00:32:30,515 --> 00:32:33,780
They're going faster than we are.
We're in the fast lane.

404
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:36,719
- They're cutting me off.
- No one's cutting you off!

405
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,418
- They're getting in front. I can't go faster.
- I don't wanna argue.

406
00:32:40,492 --> 00:32:42,859
Let's just get there as quickly as possible.

407
00:32:42,928 --> 00:32:46,125
You think we'll get to Washington
and it won't be there?

408
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:51,967
A crop duster was arrested
as he dropped leaflets from the air.

409
00:32:52,037 --> 00:32:55,200
- Everybody's leavin'.
- Can you give us some of your time?

410
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:59,471
We've got to stop them! I was kidnapped
by space aliens ten years ago!

411
00:32:59,544 --> 00:33:01,842
They did all kinds of experiments on me!

412
00:33:01,913 --> 00:33:05,178
They've been studying us,
finding out our weaknesses!

413
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:08,049
We've gotta stop ‘em.
They're gonna kill us all!

414
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,852
Some people attribute his behavior
to post-traumatic stress syndrome

415
00:33:12,924 --> 00:33:14,915
from his service as a pilot in Vietnam.

416
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:17,462
Others have a more unusual theory.

417
00:33:17,529 --> 00:33:19,520
How would you describe Mr Casse?

418
00:33:19,598 --> 00:33:22,260
- Keeps to himself. Quiet.
- Private.

419
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,701
When they took him up in the spaceship,

420
00:33:24,769 --> 00:33:27,568
the aliens abused him...

421
00:33:27,639 --> 00:33:29,334
sexually.

422
00:33:29,407 --> 00:33:31,739
Mr Casse is in the county lockup...

423
00:33:31,810 --> 00:33:33,801
Pack up. We're leaving.

424
00:33:35,547 --> 00:33:37,606
He may be released later tonight.

425
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,310
Miguel, what about Dad?

426
00:33:40,385 --> 00:33:43,013
This could be our last night on Earth.

427
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:47,887
You don't wanna die a virgin, do you?

428
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:51,390
- Come on! We're going.
- No, I'm not goin' anywhere.

429
00:33:51,463 --> 00:33:53,192
Miguel!

430
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,256
Stop it!

431
00:33:58,003 --> 00:34:02,668
Thanks a lot, partner! Remember, get
as far away from these things as you can!

432
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,504
You read my mind!

433
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,378
We gotta get as far away
from these things as we can!

434
00:34:10,448 --> 00:34:12,917
- They let you out?
- You damn right!

435
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:16,784
They got better fish to fry now,
believe you me!

436
00:34:16,855 --> 00:34:18,550
Come on, boy!

437
00:34:18,623 --> 00:34:18,657
The LAPD is asking Los Angelenos
not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft.

438
00:34:18,657 --> 00:34:23,618
The LAPD is asking Los Angelenos
not to fire their guns at the visitor spacecraft.

439
00:34:23,695 --> 00:34:27,256
You may inadvertently trigger
an interstellar war.

440
00:34:27,332 --> 00:34:30,597
Do you think we can find something better
to do with our time?

441
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:32,660
Where you been, Stevie?

442
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:36,002
Man, this is unbelievable. This is, like, huge.

443
00:34:36,074 --> 00:34:40,068
- They've recalled everybody.
- Looks like the mail's still working.

444
00:34:43,248 --> 00:34:46,377
You'll have to do the honors for me, man.

445
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:49,512
- You're a wuss!
- Whatever. Shut up and read it.

446
00:34:49,888 --> 00:34:53,085
It says, "Captain Steven Hiller"...

447
00:34:53,158 --> 00:34:54,353
loser.

448
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:57,225
- Come on, come on!
- Blah blah blah blah!

449
00:34:57,295 --> 00:35:00,196
"We regret to inform you that

450
00:35:00,265 --> 00:35:03,599
despite your excellent record of service..."

451
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,897
I'm sorry, man.

452
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,669
You know what you need to do?

453
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:13,644
You need to, like, kiss some serious booty
to get ahead in this world.

454
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,703
That's what I'm trying to tell you.

455
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:17,771
See, I like the one-knee approach

456
00:35:17,849 --> 00:35:22,013
because it puts the booty,
like, right in front of the lip...

457
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:24,715
- What's this?
- That's nothin'.

458
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:25,779
What is this?

459
00:35:25,857 --> 00:35:29,259
Jasmine kinda has a thing for dolphins.

460
00:35:29,327 --> 00:35:32,160
Steve, this is a wedding ring.

461
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,802
I thought you said
you were gonna break it all off?

462
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:46,668
You know I really like Jasmine.

463
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:48,736
You know that, right?

464
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:53,751
But you're never gonna get to fly
the space shuttle if you marry a stripper.

465
00:36:01,693 --> 00:36:05,254
It could only happen in California.

466
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,321
Here's a special report.

467
00:36:07,866 --> 00:36:11,894
Hundreds of UFO fanatics have gathered
on rooftops in Los Angeles

468
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,098
to welcome the new arrivals.

469
00:36:14,172 --> 00:36:16,573
Oh, God! hope they bring back Elvis!

470
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:20,839
I just came in to get my check tonight
and I got talked into working.

471
00:36:20,912 --> 00:36:22,903
Oh, I must have been trippin'.

472
00:36:22,981 --> 00:36:25,109
It's been called the party of the century!

473
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:27,675
Everyone is invited,
especially you-know-who.

474
00:36:27,752 --> 00:36:30,312
- This is so cool!
- Oh, please!

475
00:36:30,789 --> 00:36:34,657
Oh, hey!
I made it before I came in tonight.

476
00:36:35,326 --> 00:36:37,021
Check it out!

477
00:36:37,095 --> 00:36:40,360
Now, I know you're not
thinking about joining those idiots.

478
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:43,595
Oh, I am going over there
as soon as I get off.

479
00:36:43,668 --> 00:36:46,660
- Do you wanna come?
- Tiffany, listen to me a sec.

480
00:36:46,738 --> 00:36:50,697
I have got a really bad feeling about this.
I don't want you to go.

481
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:53,267
- Promise me you won't.
- Oh!

482
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,438
Come on, girl! Promise me.

483
00:36:56,514 --> 00:36:58,505
I promise.

484
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:00,210
OK.

485
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:01,377
Look,

486
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,444
I'm out of town for a while.

487
00:37:03,722 --> 00:37:05,713
- Later.
- Bye.

488
00:37:10,729 --> 00:37:15,565
Everyone is trying of get out of Washington,
and we're the only schmucks trying to get in.

489
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,963
What the hell is that?

490
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,238
Pops, this is every phone book in America.

491
00:37:23,308 --> 00:37:26,243
You think an important person
like Constance will be listed?

492
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:29,542
She always keeps her portable phone
listed for emergencies.

493
00:37:29,614 --> 00:37:32,242
Demonstrators at the White House
are protesting

494
00:37:32,317 --> 00:37:36,254
the military involvement
with our first contact with the alien visitors.

495
00:37:45,864 --> 00:37:47,730
So?

496
00:37:47,799 --> 00:37:50,268
Do you wanna ring the bell, or should 1?

497
00:37:52,337 --> 00:37:55,705
- Oh, perfect, she's using it.
- What? It's busy?

498
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,607
Yeah, I can use her signal

499
00:37:58,676 --> 00:38:01,407
to triangulate her exact position
in the White House.

500
00:38:02,013 --> 00:38:04,539
- You can do that?
- Yeah.

501
00:38:04,616 --> 00:38:06,914
All cable repairmen can, Pops.

502
00:38:06,985 --> 00:38:08,976
Take care.

503
00:38:11,389 --> 00:38:13,380
Are Mr Whitmore's actions

504
00:38:13,458 --> 00:38:15,358
a) ultra brave

505
00:38:15,426 --> 00:38:17,417
or b) foolhardy?

506
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,491
- What?
- Don't hang up, sweetie.

507
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:23,125
David! How did you get this number?

508
00:38:23,201 --> 00:38:27,570
- Do me a favor. Walk to the window.
- And I'm looking for what?

509
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,607
You'll see.

510
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:31,665
Over here.

511
00:38:32,844 --> 00:38:34,972
See us?

512
00:38:35,046 --> 00:38:37,515
How does he do that?

513
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:49,787
In light of our apparent inability
to communicate with the visitors,

514
00:38:49,861 --> 00:38:53,320
Pentagon officials have retrofit
this Skylift helicopter

515
00:38:53,398 --> 00:38:55,662
with a visual communications device.

516
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,327
- Mr President.
- Gentlemen, be seated.

517
00:38:59,904 --> 00:39:02,771
- Where are we now?
- We're just commencing liftoff.

518
00:39:02,841 --> 00:39:05,708
..and refitted
with these enormous light panels

519
00:39:05,777 --> 00:39:08,439
that are attached to the hull
and onto the sides.

520
00:39:08,513 --> 00:39:10,743
Echo One, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

521
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:12,943
I repeat, Welcome Wagon is in the air.

522
00:39:13,017 --> 00:39:16,476
Roger, Welcome Wagon.
Echo One, right beside you.

523
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,489
This is something I would never believe
that I would be!

524
00:39:19,557 --> 00:39:21,548
In the White House! Look at this!

525
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:25,085
If I knew I was gonna meet the President,
I would have worn a tie.

526
00:39:25,163 --> 00:39:27,393
Look at me, I look like a schlemiel.

527
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,835
Oy, my God!

528
00:39:30,902 --> 00:39:35,999
- David, I don't know if he'll want to see you.
- Then we're wasting time, we should go.

529
00:39:36,074 --> 00:39:39,339
- Why wouldn't he listen?
- Last time I saw him, we had a fight.

530
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:42,004
You walked in the room
and punched him in the head.

531
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:44,378
- The President!
- He wasn't president then.

532
00:39:44,449 --> 00:39:46,918
I punched him, he fought back.
It was a fight!

533
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,976
A fight that you started!

534
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:51,044
David thought I was having an affair.

535
00:39:51,122 --> 00:39:53,284
- With the President?
- Which I wasn't!

536
00:39:53,358 --> 00:39:55,725
Either go get him,
or we should head back.

537
00:39:55,793 --> 00:39:59,024
All right, I'll get him.
Wait here, and don't touch anything!

538
00:39:59,731 --> 00:40:01,722
You punched the President?

539
00:40:01,799 --> 00:40:03,096
God!

540
00:40:11,242 --> 00:40:13,210
Nearing point of contact, Echo One.

541
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:17,340
- We're closing in.
- Roger that. Begin sequence when ready.

542
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,884
The three choppers are steadily approaching

543
00:40:19,951 --> 00:40:24,513
what has been unanimously agreed
to be the front of these spaceships...

544
00:40:26,658 --> 00:40:28,649
You're leaving now?

545
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:31,093
See if they've got
those pens they give away.

546
00:40:31,162 --> 00:40:32,527
Dad, what?

547
00:40:32,597 --> 00:40:35,692
I just don't have a choice.

548
00:40:35,767 --> 00:40:38,702
- I don't have time for this.
- Two minutes, Tom, please.

549
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:41,501
Mr President, Julius Levinson.
David is my son.

550
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:44,872
- I told you he wouldn't listen.
- You have to tell him now.

551
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,537
David, you have to tell him!
David, tell him!

552
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:53,149
I know why we have satellite disruption.

553
00:40:55,153 --> 00:40:57,121
All right. Go ahead.

554
00:40:57,188 --> 00:40:59,179
OK.

555
00:41:00,992 --> 00:41:05,691
Let's say that you wanted to coordinate with
spaceships on different sides of the Earth.

556
00:41:05,763 --> 00:41:08,130
You couldn't send a direct signal, right?

557
00:41:09,267 --> 00:41:13,363
- You mean line of sight?
- Right. The curve of the Earth prevents it.

558
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:17,875
You'd need satellites to relay that signal
in order to reach each ship.

559
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:21,810
Well, I found a signal hidden inside

560
00:41:21,879 --> 00:41:24,280
our own satellite system.

561
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:28,083
Excuse me, Mr President.

562
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,620
They're starting.

563
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,023
They're using our own satellites against us.

564
00:41:38,563 --> 00:41:40,031
The clock is ticking.

565
00:41:44,469 --> 00:41:46,836
- Bringing it in to hover.
- Welcome Wagon,

566
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:49,373
Echo One, approaching alien ship.

567
00:41:51,042 --> 00:41:53,204
Initiating communication sequence.

568
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:57,282
Welcome Wagon has commenced.

569
00:42:03,187 --> 00:42:06,054
General Grey,
coordinate with the Atlantic Command.

570
00:42:06,124 --> 00:42:09,185
- Tell them to evacuate people from the cities.
- Yes, sir.

571
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:12,161
Get those helicopters away from the ship.
Call them back!

572
00:42:12,230 --> 00:42:14,494
- What the hell's going on?
- We're leaving.

573
00:42:14,565 --> 00:42:16,033
Kim! My daughter.

574
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,027
There's something happening here.

575
00:42:23,841 --> 00:42:25,707
They're responding.

576
00:42:25,777 --> 00:42:27,575
Something is happening.

577
00:42:30,615 --> 00:42:34,347
It looks like there's activity.
This may be a response, Echo One.

578
00:42:34,419 --> 00:42:36,547
We see it, too. Can't identify it.

579
00:42:48,466 --> 00:42:48,499
We are evacuating. I repeat,
we are evacuating the White House.

580
00:42:48,499 --> 00:42:52,299
We are evacuating. I repeat,
we are evacuating the White House.

581
00:42:54,605 --> 00:42:57,575
Load the rest of the staff
in the second helicopter.

582
00:42:59,277 --> 00:43:02,269
- Is my wife in the air?
- She will be shortly.

583
00:43:02,346 --> 00:43:03,677
Nice. Very nice.

584
00:43:03,748 --> 00:43:06,149
OK! Close the door! Hatch secure!

585
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,875
- We have our own phone.
- Yeah.

586
00:43:12,056 --> 00:43:13,455
Move outta here.

587
00:43:16,494 --> 00:43:18,895
The President's ordered an evacuation.

588
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,557
Our prayers go out to the pilots' families.

589
00:43:21,632 --> 00:43:24,101
- Indeed, God help us all.
- Mrs Whitmore.

590
00:43:24,168 --> 00:43:26,865
The visitors responded with terrifying...

591
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:30,738
Authorities have called for
the evacuation of Los Angeles County.

592
00:43:30,808 --> 00:43:34,369
People are advised to avoid
the highways wherever possible.

593
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:36,539
Oh, yeah, great! Now he tells me.

594
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:45,351
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

595
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:50,452
Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.

596
00:44:06,477 --> 00:44:09,174
- Can we move it along?
- Dr Katz's office.

597
00:44:09,247 --> 00:44:12,478
- Hello. Dr Katz, please.
- I'm sorry, he's not available.

598
00:44:12,550 --> 00:44:16,009
For $300 an hour, you can put me
through to his house in the Hamptons!

599
00:44:24,328 --> 00:44:27,423
This is the Los Angeles Police Department.

600
00:44:27,498 --> 00:44:31,264
Please vacate the premises immediately
for your own safety.

601
00:44:33,371 --> 00:44:35,806
Mrs Whitmore!

602
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,807
You must leave now.

603
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:46,043
The First Lady's secured. We're on the move.

604
00:44:56,360 --> 00:44:58,852
They're opening up!

605
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:12,103
It's so pretty.

606
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,727
Get the hell outta here!

607
00:45:54,452 --> 00:45:57,854
Go ahead, pilot.
We're ready to take off right now.

608
00:45:57,922 --> 00:45:59,913
Can we get a blanket for Patricia?

609
00:46:03,494 --> 00:46:05,485
Here.

610
00:46:19,477 --> 00:46:21,468
Time's up.

611
00:47:25,009 --> 00:47:27,171
Oh, crap.

612
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:06,605
Oh, my God! Come on, Dylan! We gotta go!

613
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:08,668
Come on, Boomer!

614
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,809
Boomer!

615
00:49:53,624 --> 00:49:55,285
Boomer!

616
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:25,619
Reports are unclear
as to the extent of the devastation,

617
00:50:25,689 --> 00:50:29,250
but it appears that Los Angeles,
Washington, and New York are in ruins.

618
00:50:29,326 --> 00:50:31,488
Good God!

619
00:50:31,562 --> 00:50:33,121
I've been sayin' it.

620
00:50:33,197 --> 00:50:36,428
I've been sayin' it for ten damn years!
Ain't I, Miguel?

621
00:50:36,500 --> 00:50:38,491
Huh? I've been sayin' it!

622
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,465
Dad, I'm sick. I don't feel good.

623
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:43,837
Pull it over, man.

624
00:50:52,449 --> 00:50:54,440
We're gonna be all right, Troy.

625
00:50:54,518 --> 00:50:56,509
Yeah, leave me alone. I got it.

626
00:51:00,291 --> 00:51:01,622
Miguel!

627
00:51:01,692 --> 00:51:03,683
Look at all that.

628
00:51:26,750 --> 00:51:29,947
We could have evacuated
the cities hours ago.

629
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:35,591
That's the advantage of being a fighter pilot.

630
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:39,195
In the Gulf War, we knew what we had to do.

631
00:51:41,665 --> 00:51:43,656
This is just...

632
00:51:44,501 --> 00:51:46,868
not simple anymore.

633
00:51:46,937 --> 00:51:49,269
A lot of people died today.

634
00:51:55,079 --> 00:51:57,070
How many didn't have to?

635
00:51:59,183 --> 00:52:01,618
Any news on my wife yet?

636
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,081
The helicopter never made it to Nullius.

637
00:52:08,125 --> 00:52:10,423
No radio contact.

638
00:52:17,301 --> 00:52:19,292
Come on, Dylan. Stay close.

639
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:30,870
Here itis.

640
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,801
What happened, Mommy?

641
00:52:59,810 --> 00:53:01,904
I don't know, baby.

642
00:53:01,979 --> 00:53:04,914
You men will be the first wave
in our counterattack.

643
00:53:04,982 --> 00:53:06,973
Our target is to the north,

644
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:10,419
centered above what remains
of downtown Los Angeles.

645
00:53:10,487 --> 00:53:12,478
Our Black Knight Squadron...

646
00:53:12,556 --> 00:53:15,856
- Are you scared, man?
- Nope.

647
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:18,827
- You?
- Nope.

648
00:53:21,298 --> 00:53:24,063
- Hold me!
- Hey, hey, pay attention.

649
00:53:25,169 --> 00:53:27,297
Something you wanna add, Captain Hiller?

650
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:31,035
No, sir. Just a little anxious
to whup ET's ass, that's all.

651
00:53:32,743 --> 00:53:34,837
You'll get your chance.

652
00:53:34,912 --> 00:53:37,381
You'll all get your chance.

653
00:53:37,448 --> 00:53:39,280
Good hunting.

654
00:53:39,349 --> 00:53:40,942
Dismissed!

655
00:53:41,018 --> 00:53:44,579
Let's kick the tires and light the fires,
Big Daddy!

656
00:53:48,125 --> 00:53:51,220
Let's bring it home.
Bring that bad boy home, Captain!

657
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:52,888
- You loose?
- Yes, sir!

658
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:54,624
Got your victory dance?

659
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:57,497
Oh, I got it right here... yeah!

660
00:53:57,568 --> 00:54:01,505
Hey, don't get pre-patrol on me.
We don't light up till the fat lady sings.

661
00:54:01,572 --> 00:54:03,563
I'm all ears, brother!

662
00:54:11,849 --> 00:54:13,840
You the man!

663
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,715
- All right, gentlemen, we're on.
- General, it's NORAD.

664
00:54:24,094 --> 00:54:26,062
General Grey here.

665
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,325
Al?

666
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:30,196
All communications with the cities are down.

667
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,726
- All systems gone.
- For intelligence, we believe it's a total loss.

668
00:54:33,804 --> 00:54:36,432
How about our boys? Where are they?

669
00:54:36,507 --> 00:54:39,067
ETA to target, four minutes.

670
00:54:47,351 --> 00:54:49,183
I shouldn't have left her.

671
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,119
Don't worry about it, big man.

672
00:54:51,188 --> 00:54:53,555
I'm sure she got outta here
before it happened.

673
00:54:53,624 --> 00:54:56,958
Or, as the good Reverend would say,

674
00:54:57,027 --> 00:55:00,292
"Why we're on this particular mission,

675
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:02,025
we'll never know."

676
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:05,091
"But I do know, here today,

677
00:55:05,169 --> 00:55:08,469
that the Black Knights
will emerge victorious once again.”

678
00:55:08,539 --> 00:55:11,702
- Amen, man!
- Amen, Reverend.

679
00:55:25,122 --> 00:55:27,489
Holy God!

680
00:55:30,961 --> 00:55:32,929
Lock and load!

681
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:36,790
Roger that.

682
00:55:36,867 --> 00:55:39,734
LA attack squadron
has Amraam missiles locked on target.

683
00:55:39,803 --> 00:55:42,363
Washington and New York squadrons
report lock on.

684
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:43,600
Fire at will.

685
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:45,733
- Fire at will.
- Fire at will.

686
00:55:47,411 --> 00:55:48,742
Knights, we are red and free.

687
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:50,837
Knight One, fox three!

688
00:55:51,481 --> 00:55:53,176
Knight Three, fox three!

689
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,216
Knight Seven, fox three.

690
00:55:57,487 --> 00:56:00,218
Missiles have been fired.

691
00:56:19,209 --> 00:56:22,372
- Are they not getting through?
- No, sir, not one.

692
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:25,575
Command, Knight One.
Switchin' to Sidewinders, moving in.

693
00:56:29,253 --> 00:56:32,655
Knight Three, low 50 knots reference 120.

694
00:56:33,624 --> 00:56:35,718
Knight Seven, 120.

695
00:56:35,792 --> 00:56:38,352
Knight One, sweep lock.

696
00:56:38,428 --> 00:56:39,418
Knight Seven...

697
00:56:44,368 --> 00:56:45,494
Come on, come on!

698
00:56:51,441 --> 00:56:55,002
They must have a protective shield
over the hull! Knights, pull up!

699
00:57:00,550 --> 00:57:03,747
- Knight Three, pull up!
- Complete failure in the stators!

700
00:57:14,498 --> 00:57:16,193
Blow through, blow through!

701
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,735
Too many of ‘em!

702
00:57:20,504 --> 00:57:22,199
They got another one, sir.

703
00:57:25,475 --> 00:57:28,536
Oh, no, you did not shoot
that green shit at me!

704
00:57:31,448 --> 00:57:33,542
I got ya covered, Big Daddy!

705
00:57:37,321 --> 00:57:38,584
Damn, they got shields, too!

706
00:57:49,866 --> 00:57:52,335
Let's go, Knights! Move, Knights! Move!

707
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,370
Jesus!

708
00:57:58,442 --> 00:58:00,467
They got another one, sir. And two more.

709
00:58:00,544 --> 00:58:02,911
- They're dropping like flies.
- We're losing them.

710
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:04,971
All right, get ‘em outta there.

711
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:09,952
Squadron leaders, retreat to fallback position.
Abort mission right away!

712
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:16,918
We're gonna have to make a run for this one!
Let's get low and fast!

713
00:58:16,994 --> 00:58:19,088
I gotcha, Big Daddy! Let's get ‘em!

714
00:58:21,531 --> 00:58:23,522
Watch the deck!

715
00:58:31,174 --> 00:58:34,974
- Squadron leader, abort! Abort!
- This isn't happening fast enough!

716
00:58:35,045 --> 00:58:36,171
Get ‘em outta there!

717
00:58:42,886 --> 00:58:44,786
The monitor! Where's the picture?

718
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:46,448
We've lost the satellite.

719
00:58:50,527 --> 00:58:53,519
- We got two on our six, Jimmy. Shackle!
- Roger.

720
00:58:55,032 --> 00:58:57,501
Come on, come on, come on!
Move, move, move!

721
00:58:58,835 --> 00:59:03,363
- You told me, like, quite all right!
- They ain't got nothin' for us! Let's push it!

722
00:59:03,440 --> 00:59:07,809
- I can't shake ‘em.
- Yes, you can. Just the way I showed you.

723
00:59:07,878 --> 00:59:10,472
- I'm gonna try somethin'.
- Nothin' stupid!

724
00:59:10,547 --> 00:59:13,016
- You know me!
- That's what I'm talking about.

725
00:59:13,083 --> 00:59:15,484
Jimmy, you can't bank at that speed!

726
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:18,554
Jimmy, he's closing on you!

727
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:24,523
- Put your mask back on! That's an order!
- I can't breathe!

728
00:59:25,762 --> 00:59:27,560
Jimmy!

729
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:29,194
Jimmy!

730
00:59:32,102 --> 00:59:33,536
Jimmy, no!

731
00:59:33,603 --> 00:59:35,833
That's affirmative. We have incoming.

732
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:37,897
- Let me have it, son.
- You got it.

733
00:59:37,974 --> 00:59:39,965
Friendly?

734
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:42,034
Sergeant?

735
00:59:42,112 --> 00:59:44,046
I don't think so.

736
01:00:11,308 --> 01:00:12,798
Come on and get me!

737
01:00:17,814 --> 01:00:19,612
What are you gonna shoot next?

738
01:00:19,683 --> 01:00:22,482
Where you at, baby?! Come on! Come on!

739
01:00:27,791 --> 01:00:29,088
You can't hit nothin"!

740
01:00:47,711 --> 01:00:49,702
Low bridge!

741
01:00:52,616 --> 01:00:55,108
See if you can fly that thing under cover!

742
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:01,822
Hope you got an airbag!

743
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:41,187
Son of a bitch!

744
01:01:44,401 --> 01:01:46,392
This way! This way!

745
01:01:46,469 --> 01:01:48,437
Get off! Get off of me!

746
01:01:48,505 --> 01:01:50,303
That's what you'll get!

747
01:01:50,373 --> 01:01:52,034
Look at you!

748
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:55,237
Ship all banged up! Who's the man?!

749
01:01:55,312 --> 01:01:58,304
Huh? Who's the man?!
Wait till I get another plane!

750
01:01:58,381 --> 01:02:00,975
I'm linin' all your friends up, right beside you!

751
01:02:02,319 --> 01:02:05,311
Where you at? Huh? Where you at?

752
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:18,591
Welcome to Earth.

753
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:31,873
That's what I call a close encounter.

754
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:39,753
Baby, stay right here.
Stay right here with Boomer.

755
01:02:48,632 --> 01:02:51,329
Keys. Come on, keys.

756
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:52,964
Yes!

757
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:56,233
Come, baby, come on. Come on!

758
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:58,036
Yes!

759
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,840
Reports indicate that this battle
has repeated itself all over the world

760
01:03:01,911 --> 01:03:03,879
with the exact same results.

761
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:07,144
See, Troy? You're feelin' better already.

762
01:03:08,418 --> 01:03:10,682
Everybody's packin' up. They're leavin'.

763
01:03:10,754 --> 01:03:15,419
- They said a spaceship is headed this way.
- We'd better leave, too, don't you think?

764
01:03:24,134 --> 01:03:27,536
It's Air Force One, for crying out loud.
Still he gets sick.

765
01:03:27,604 --> 01:03:29,538
I don't feel too good.

766
01:03:29,606 --> 01:03:31,597
Look at me, huh? Like a rock.

767
01:03:31,675 --> 01:03:34,007
Could be bad weather or good weather.

768
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:35,636
We could go up or down.

769
01:03:35,712 --> 01:03:38,807
We could go back, we could go forwards,
side to side...

770
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:42,911
What did I say?

771
01:03:46,122 --> 01:03:48,750
- He still gets airsick, huh?
- Yeah.

772
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:51,760
Julius, with all of this, I...

773
01:03:51,861 --> 01:03:54,523
I didn't get a chance to thank you two.

774
01:03:55,865 --> 01:03:58,095
All he could think of was getting to you.

775
01:04:01,304 --> 01:04:03,295
There's still love there, I think.

776
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:07,643
Love was never a problem.

777
01:04:07,711 --> 01:04:09,702
All you need is love.

778
01:04:10,780 --> 01:04:12,976
John Lennon. Smart man.

779
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,040
Shot in the back, very sad.

780
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,918
We've moved as many of our forces
away from our bases as possible.

781
01:04:20,990 --> 01:04:25,450
- But we've already sustained heavy losses.
- I spoke with the Joint Chiefs at NORAD.

782
01:04:25,528 --> 01:04:28,862
They agree we must counterattack
with a full nuclear strike.

783
01:04:28,932 --> 01:04:30,491
Over American soil?

784
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:35,004
You're saying we should sacrifice
more innocent American civilians?

785
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:38,371
If we don't strike soon,
there may not be much of an America left!

786
01:04:38,441 --> 01:04:40,466
Sir! They've taken out NORAD.

787
01:04:40,543 --> 01:04:42,534
- What?
- It's gone, sir.

788
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:44,580
My God!

789
01:04:44,681 --> 01:04:47,150
The Vice President? The Joint Chiefs?

790
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:49,208
Mr President.

791
01:04:49,285 --> 01:04:51,310
We must launch.

792
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:55,985
A delay now would be more costly
than when you waited to evacuate the cities.

793
01:04:56,059 --> 01:05:01,293
You're not gonna launch nuclear weapons.
You'll kill them and us. If we fire nukes...

794
01:05:01,364 --> 01:05:05,301
- Sir, may I remind you you are a guest here.
- You ever hear of nuclear winter?

795
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:08,338
- It's the end of life as we know it.
- Just go.

796
01:05:08,405 --> 01:05:10,464
I don't have to go. It can't be allowed!

797
01:05:10,540 --> 01:05:13,566
- Shut up! Captain, get him out!
- Don't tell him to shut up!

798
01:05:15,545 --> 01:05:18,139
You'd all be dead now
if it wasn't for my David!

799
01:05:18,214 --> 01:05:20,546
None of you did anything to prevent this!

800
01:05:20,617 --> 01:05:24,349
There was nothing we could do.
We were totally unprepared for this.

801
01:05:24,421 --> 01:05:27,015
- Don't give me unprepared!
- Come on, Julius.

802
01:05:27,090 --> 01:05:29,889
It was, what?
In the 1950s, you had that spaceship.

803
01:05:29,959 --> 01:05:34,260
- Dad. Look, Dad...
- Yeah, that thing you found in New Mexico!

804
01:05:34,330 --> 01:05:36,560
- Where was that?
- No, not the spaceship.

805
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:40,536
Roswell. Roswell, New Mexico.
No, you had the spaceship and the bodies!

806
01:05:40,603 --> 01:05:42,935
- Come on.
- They were locked up in a bunker.

807
01:05:43,006 --> 01:05:44,974
- Where was that?
- 1 don't know.

808
01:05:45,041 --> 01:05:49,137
Area 51. Area 51.
You knew then! And you did nothing.

809
01:05:50,613 --> 01:05:51,944
Sir.

810
01:05:52,015 --> 01:05:54,848
Regardless of what
you may have read in the tabloids,

811
01:05:54,918 --> 01:05:58,411
there have never been any spacecraft
recovered by our government.

812
01:05:58,488 --> 01:06:02,015
Take my word for it. There's no Area 51.

813
01:06:02,091 --> 01:06:04,560
And there's no recovered spaceship.

814
01:06:04,627 --> 01:06:06,789
Excuse me, Mr President.

815
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:11,624
That's not entirely accurate.

816
01:06:16,539 --> 01:06:18,530
What? Which part?

817
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:26,907
Hold on, everybody! Hold on!

818
01:06:27,951 --> 01:06:28,747
Sorry.

819
01:06:49,772 --> 01:06:51,763
- Can you give me a hand?
- Yeah, sure.

820
01:06:58,715 --> 01:07:00,706
Oh, God.

821
01:07:07,524 --> 01:07:09,549
OK, OK, let's get this off.

822
01:07:12,629 --> 01:07:14,654
Here, let me help you.

823
01:07:15,231 --> 01:07:17,222
She's hurt pretty badly.

824
01:07:21,271 --> 01:07:24,263
You know,
this was supposed to be my weekend off.

825
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:27,366
But, nooo!

826
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:30,202
You got me out here, draggin' your heavy ass

827
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:32,214
through the burnin' desert

828
01:07:32,348 --> 01:07:35,511
with your dreadlocks
stickin' out the back of my parachute.

829
01:07:35,585 --> 01:07:38,555
You gotta come down here with an attitude,

830
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,851
actin' all big and bad.

831
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:44,783
And what the hell is that smell?!

832
01:07:49,399 --> 01:07:51,390
I could have been at a barbecue!

833
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:54,334
But I ain't mad.

834
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:57,772
It's all right, it's all right.

835
01:08:13,056 --> 01:08:14,217
Hey!

836
01:08:14,290 --> 01:08:17,157
Hey! Hey!

837
01:08:22,365 --> 01:08:23,696
Hey!

838
01:08:36,846 --> 01:08:38,905
Do you need a lift, soldier?

839
01:08:38,982 --> 01:08:42,111
When I flew overhead,
I saw a base not too far from here.

840
01:08:44,320 --> 01:08:46,288
It ain't on the map.

841
01:08:46,356 --> 01:08:48,723
Trust me, it's there.

842
01:09:10,313 --> 01:09:12,304
Mr President. General.

843
01:09:12,382 --> 01:09:14,009
Welcome to Area 51.

844
01:09:14,083 --> 01:09:15,642
Please follow me.

845
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,717
We're now 24 floors beneath the surface.

846
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:22,622
Here's our main research facility.

847
01:09:22,692 --> 01:09:27,152
- Let's see it.
- Sorry, sir, it's a clean room. It's static free...

848
01:09:27,230 --> 01:09:29,631
Open the door.

849
01:09:30,767 --> 01:09:32,758
Yes, sir.

850
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,480
My God.

851
01:09:55,558 --> 01:09:57,788
Why the hell wasn't I told about this place?

852
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:01,023
Two words, Mr President.
Plausible deniability.

853
01:10:08,504 --> 01:10:11,496
I don't understand.
Where does all this come from?

854
01:10:11,574 --> 01:10:14,134
How do you get funding
for something like this?

855
01:10:14,210 --> 01:10:17,305
You don't actually think
they spend $20,000 on a hammer,

856
01:10:17,380 --> 01:10:19,542
$30,000 on a toilet seat, do you?

857
01:10:21,617 --> 01:10:23,608
Mr President, this is Dr Okun.

858
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:27,589
He has headed up the research department
on this project for last 15 years.

859
01:10:29,325 --> 01:10:31,316
How do you do?

860
01:10:31,861 --> 01:10:33,852
Mr President!

861
01:10:34,497 --> 01:10:36,295
Wow!

862
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:37,628
This...

863
01:10:37,700 --> 01:10:39,691
What a pleasure!

864
01:10:40,470 --> 01:10:42,268
As you can imagine, they...

865
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,102
They don't let us out much.

866
01:10:45,641 --> 01:10:47,769
I can understand that.

867
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:50,405
Well!

868
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:53,814
I guess you'd like to see the big tamale, huh?

869
01:10:53,883 --> 01:10:55,874
Follow me.

870
01:11:46,402 --> 01:11:48,393
She's a beaut, ain't she?

871
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:56,643
As you can see from the repairs, we've been
trying to put her back together since the '60s.

872
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:59,807
You've had this for 40 years
and you know nothing about ‘em?

873
01:11:59,882 --> 01:12:01,145
Oh, hell, no.

874
01:12:01,217 --> 01:12:03,413
No, no, no, no. We know tons about ‘em.

875
01:12:03,486 --> 01:12:05,284
But the neatest stuff...

876
01:12:05,354 --> 01:12:09,313
The neatest stuff has
only happened in the last few days.

877
01:12:09,392 --> 01:12:14,159
We can't duplicate their type of power
so we've never been able to experiment.

878
01:12:14,230 --> 01:12:18,895
But since these guys started showing up,
all the little gizmos inside turned on.

879
01:12:20,002 --> 01:12:22,994
The last 24 hours have been really exciting.

880
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:25,336
Exciting? People are dying out there.

881
01:12:25,408 --> 01:12:28,275
Exciting isn't the word
I'd choose to describe it!

882
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,980
You guys are hoping to fly this thing, huh?

883
01:12:33,049 --> 01:12:35,484
You said you can repair their technology.

884
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:39,351
- Can you tell us anything useful about them?
- Oh, yeah. Well, I mean...

885
01:12:39,422 --> 01:12:41,652
They're not all that dissimilar from us.

886
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:46,093
Breathes oxygen,
comparable tolerances to heat, cold.

887
01:12:46,162 --> 01:12:49,564
Probably why they're interested in our planet.

888
01:12:49,932 --> 01:12:51,525
Hey...

889
01:12:51,868 --> 01:12:53,734
Hey.

890
01:12:54,470 --> 01:12:56,302
You guys wanna see ‘em?

891
01:13:06,048 --> 01:13:07,846
This is...

892
01:13:07,917 --> 01:13:09,908
This is the vault.

893
01:13:09,986 --> 01:13:12,717
Or as some of us have come to call it...

894
01:13:13,856 --> 01:13:15,847
the freak show.

895
01:13:37,747 --> 01:13:39,738
When we found them,

896
01:13:39,815 --> 01:13:43,513
they were wearing
some sort of biomechanical suits.

897
01:13:43,586 --> 01:13:47,216
Once we got ‘em off,
we learned a great deal about their anatomy.

898
01:13:47,290 --> 01:13:49,657
Eyes, ears,

899
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:51,659
no vocal chords.

900
01:13:51,727 --> 01:13:54,958
We assume they communicate
with each other by some other means.

901
01:13:55,031 --> 01:13:59,366
You're obviously not thinking
about hand signals and body language.

902
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:03,065
It's some kind of extrasensory perception.
Telepathy.

903
01:14:03,139 --> 01:14:05,073
So...

904
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:09,405
It's an organic life form.

905
01:14:12,381 --> 01:14:14,372
Can they be killed?

906
01:14:14,450 --> 01:14:16,612
Their bodies are just as frail as ours.

907
01:14:16,686 --> 01:14:19,121
These two died in the crash.

908
01:14:19,188 --> 01:14:20,986
This one a few weeks later.

909
01:14:21,057 --> 01:14:25,255
You just have to get through
their technology, which is,

910
01:14:25,328 --> 01:14:28,320
I'm sorry to say, far more advanced.

911
01:14:29,432 --> 01:14:30,695
David.

912
01:14:30,766 --> 01:14:33,133
You unlocked part of their technology.

913
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:37,730
- You cracked the code.
- No, no. All I did was stumble onto their...

914
01:14:37,807 --> 01:14:41,107
signal. I don't know how helpful I can be.

915
01:14:41,177 --> 01:14:44,772
Why don't you show him
what you've discovered so far?

916
01:14:45,748 --> 01:14:48,581
Figure out what they haven't thought of yet.

917
01:14:48,951 --> 01:14:52,046
We'll see if you're as smart
as we all hope you are.

918
01:15:02,965 --> 01:15:03,830
What code?

919
01:15:25,121 --> 01:15:28,386
Captain Steven Hiller,
United States Marine Corps.

920
01:15:28,457 --> 01:15:31,154
I'm sorry, Captain. You don't have clearance.

921
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:34,219
OK. Come here.

922
01:15:34,296 --> 01:15:36,094
You wanna see my clearance?

923
01:15:39,468 --> 01:15:42,870
- Maybe I'll just leave this here with you.
- Let 'em pass.

924
01:15:42,938 --> 01:15:45,600
- Let 'em pass!
- Get the hell out of the way!

925
01:15:47,276 --> 01:15:49,267
Did you see that?

926
01:15:51,781 --> 01:15:54,045
Oh, boy. Oh, boy!

927
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,352
- How long has he been unconscious?
- About three hours.

928
01:15:59,422 --> 01:16:01,390
Let's get him into containment. Stat!

929
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:05,360
As the former head of the CIA,
you knew about this place.

930
01:16:05,428 --> 01:16:08,989
- When were you planning to inform us?
- It had been deemed classified.

931
01:16:09,065 --> 01:16:12,296
You should have told us about this
when they first arrived!

932
01:16:12,368 --> 01:16:15,463
You should have warned us
before we launched a counterattack

933
01:16:15,538 --> 01:16:17,905
that cost the lives of hundreds of our pilots!

934
01:16:17,973 --> 01:16:22,035
We could not have known that our fighters
would have been that ineffective!

935
01:16:22,111 --> 01:16:23,203
Mr President.

936
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:27,045
The little bit of information we have
comes directly into this room.

937
01:16:27,116 --> 01:16:29,676
Atlanta, Chicago, and Philadelphia.

938
01:16:30,519 --> 01:16:32,544
Destroyed.

939
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:36,922
NATO and Western Allied installations
were the first to be taken out.

940
01:16:36,992 --> 01:16:38,687
Then we were hit.

941
01:16:38,761 --> 01:16:41,731
They knew exactly where and how to hit us.

942
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:43,959
- And our forces?
- We're down to 15%.

943
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:49,199
If you calculate the time it takes
to destroy a city and move on,

944
01:16:49,271 --> 01:16:53,799
we're looking at the worldwide destruction
of every major city

945
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:56,635
in the next 36 hours.

946
01:16:59,115 --> 01:17:01,243
We're being exterminated.

947
01:17:04,286 --> 01:17:06,277
Mr President!

948
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:08,346
This is Captain Steven Hiller.

949
01:17:08,424 --> 01:17:10,153
- Captain.
- Mr President.

950
01:17:10,226 --> 01:17:11,455
Well done.

951
01:17:11,527 --> 01:17:14,929
- Where is it now?
- It's isolated in the containment lab, sir.

952
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:17,922
I'd like to go see it.

953
01:17:23,672 --> 01:17:27,040
General, I'm really anxious
to get back to El Toro.

954
01:17:29,712 --> 01:17:31,703
Hasn't anyone told you?

955
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:37,218
El Toro has been completely destroyed.

956
01:18:29,872 --> 01:18:31,863
We were lucky.

957
01:18:32,041 --> 01:18:34,703
Today was the first time I used the subway.

958
01:18:34,777 --> 01:18:36,939
Thank God for the Metro Rail.

959
01:18:37,446 --> 01:18:39,437
This should last us a while.

960
01:18:39,515 --> 01:18:42,177
Don't move. I'll get it for you.
Stay still.

961
01:18:43,586 --> 01:18:45,577
He's your son?

962
01:18:46,155 --> 01:18:47,816
He's my angel.

963
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:51,121
Was his father stationed here?

964
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:52,888
Nah, he...

965
01:18:53,495 --> 01:18:55,486
He wasn't his father.

966
01:18:56,999 --> 01:19:00,196
But I was kinda hopin'
he wanted the job, though.

967
01:19:03,739 --> 01:19:07,232
- So what do you do for a living?
- I'm a dancer.

968
01:19:08,143 --> 01:19:10,077
Ballet?

969
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:12,978
No. Exotic.

970
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:17,445
Oh. Sorry.

971
01:19:17,519 --> 01:19:20,045
Don't be. I'm not.

972
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:22,614
It's good money. Besides...

973
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:24,420
my baby's worth it.

974
01:19:24,493 --> 01:19:27,053
Dylan! Come here.

975
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:30,155
I want you to meet the First Lady.

976
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:34,759
- Hello.
- Hi.

977
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:38,771
I didn't know that you'd recognized me.

978
01:19:38,841 --> 01:19:40,775
Well, I didn't want to say nothin".

979
01:19:40,843 --> 01:19:42,572
I voted for the other guy.

980
01:19:45,147 --> 01:19:49,914
- Life-support monitors recording.
- So if we screw up, it's all on tape.

981
01:19:49,985 --> 01:19:51,316
Come on, come on.

982
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:54,118
Let's get this biomechanical suit off.

983
01:19:54,189 --> 01:19:56,556
Put the spreader here, along the ridge.

984
01:19:56,625 --> 01:20:00,152
Microprobe thingamajig goes right here.
Pick there. Good.

985
01:20:00,296 --> 01:20:03,596
All right, now spread it very, very gently.

986
01:20:03,666 --> 01:20:05,327
Let me get in.

987
01:20:11,507 --> 01:20:13,532
Gentle, gentle, that's it.

988
01:20:14,576 --> 01:20:16,601
Run this right in...

989
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:24,111
All right. OK.

990
01:20:24,186 --> 01:20:25,676
Let's proceed.

991
01:20:25,754 --> 01:20:29,554
Now comes the... the really icky part.

992
01:20:31,226 --> 01:20:33,217
Oh, boy.

993
01:20:33,762 --> 01:20:37,221
This is one smelly, disgusting...

994
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:46,972
Oh, look at it.

995
01:20:47,042 --> 01:20:49,033
It doesn't look alive, does it?

996
01:20:53,315 --> 01:20:55,306
The arm is moving.

997
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:07,352
Doctor? Doctor?

998
01:22:00,482 --> 01:22:01,813
Dr Okun?

999
01:22:24,840 --> 01:22:28,435
Release me.

1000
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:30,842
- Open the door. Get him out!
- No, wait.

1001
01:22:45,127 --> 01:22:47,824
Release me.

1002
01:23:00,576 --> 01:23:03,546
I know there is much
we can learn from each other

1003
01:23:03,612 --> 01:23:05,603
if we can negotiate a truce.

1004
01:23:06,615 --> 01:23:08,777
We can find a way to coexist.

1005
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:13,051
Can there be a peace between us?

1006
01:23:13,856 --> 01:23:16,621
Peace?

1007
01:23:16,692 --> 01:23:19,787
No peace.

1008
01:23:25,767 --> 01:23:27,895
What is it you want us to do?

1009
01:23:30,339 --> 01:23:33,001
Die.

1010
01:23:41,383 --> 01:23:44,250
Die!

1011
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,018
Mr President.

1012
01:23:50,092 --> 01:23:52,151
Is that glass bulletproof?

1013
01:23:52,227 --> 01:23:54,059
No, sir.

1014
01:24:13,248 --> 01:24:15,410
- Are you all right?
- I saw...

1015
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:17,475
his thoughts.

1016
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:20,249
I saw what they're planning to do.

1017
01:24:22,357 --> 01:24:24,348
They're like locusts.

1018
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:27,058
They're moving from planet to planet.

1019
01:24:27,129 --> 01:24:29,120
Their whole civilization.

1020
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:33,532
After they've consumed
every natural resource, they move on.

1021
01:24:34,703 --> 01:24:36,694
And we're next.

1022
01:24:48,350 --> 01:24:50,341
Nuke ‘em.

1023
01:24:51,286 --> 01:24:53,277
Let's nuke the bastards.

1024
01:25:04,800 --> 01:25:06,791
Just my luck. No ice.

1025
01:25:06,868 --> 01:25:09,428
I take it you've heard?

1026
01:25:10,138 --> 01:25:12,402
Yeah. Toast.

1027
01:25:12,474 --> 01:25:14,568
To the end of the world.

1028
01:25:14,643 --> 01:25:17,135
He didn't come to this decision lightly.

1029
01:25:17,212 --> 01:25:19,840
He didn't have any other choice.

1030
01:25:19,915 --> 01:25:22,475
Well, you still believe in him.

1031
01:25:22,551 --> 01:25:24,576
Well, he's a good man.

1032
01:25:24,653 --> 01:25:26,519
Whoa...

1033
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:28,852
He'd better be. You left me for him.

1034
01:25:28,924 --> 01:25:32,053
Or, you know, for your career.

1035
01:25:32,127 --> 01:25:34,186
You know, it wasn't just my career.

1036
01:25:34,262 --> 01:25:37,254
It was the biggest opportunity of my life.

1037
01:25:37,332 --> 01:25:41,599
I wanted my life to make a difference.
I wanted my life to mean something.

1038
01:25:42,137 --> 01:25:44,128
And... I wasn't

1039
01:25:44,206 --> 01:25:46,197
ambitious enough for you?

1040
01:25:46,274 --> 01:25:48,936
David, you could have done
anything you wanted.

1041
01:25:49,011 --> 01:25:51,343
Research, development...

1042
01:25:51,413 --> 01:25:53,108
Honey, I was happy where I was.

1043
01:25:53,181 --> 01:25:55,980
Haven't you ever wanted to be
part of something special?

1044
01:25:59,688 --> 01:26:01,952
I was part of something special.

1045
01:26:17,305 --> 01:26:19,364
Well, if it makes any difference,

1046
01:26:19,441 --> 01:26:21,466
I never stopped loving you.

1047
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:24,878
But that wasn't enough, was it?

1048
01:26:43,465 --> 01:26:45,661
Let's pick it up, man. Let's go!

1049
01:26:52,207 --> 01:26:55,370
Let's pick it up, man!
We're on a tight schedule, let's go!

1050
01:26:55,444 --> 01:26:56,843
Go, man!

1051
01:26:56,912 --> 01:26:58,744
Pick it up!

1052
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,580
What the hell are you doin'? Get outta there!

1053
01:27:05,420 --> 01:27:08,082
I got something I gotta handle.
I'm borrowin' it.

1054
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:09,351
No, you're not, sir.

1055
01:27:09,424 --> 01:27:11,415
Do you really wanna shoot me?

1056
01:27:14,096 --> 01:27:15,860
Just tell 'em I hit you.

1057
01:27:22,037 --> 01:27:24,335
Command, this is Retal Op.

1058
01:27:24,406 --> 01:27:27,899
Squadron is in the air.
We are on station and awaiting instructions.

1059
01:27:27,976 --> 01:27:29,774
Break formation. Head to targets.

1060
01:27:34,583 --> 01:27:35,812
Sir.

1061
01:27:35,884 --> 01:27:38,251
They're breaking formation.

1062
01:27:38,320 --> 01:27:42,621
- We're initiating sequence code.
- Verification: Alpha Zulu six eight niner.

1063
01:27:42,691 --> 01:27:44,523
Which city will be reached first?

1064
01:27:44,593 --> 01:27:48,223
Houston, Texas.
ETA, six minutes and counting down.

1065
01:27:48,296 --> 01:27:51,061
- Houston.
- The major cities have been deserted.

1066
01:27:51,133 --> 01:27:55,092
Civilian casualties should
be down to a minimum.

1067
01:27:57,939 --> 01:28:00,601
Command, this is Neighborhood Watch.

1068
01:28:00,675 --> 01:28:02,234
We are in position.

1069
01:28:02,310 --> 01:28:04,904
Tracking monitors are locked on.

1070
01:28:04,980 --> 01:28:07,745
We are going to visual recon.

1071
01:28:13,288 --> 01:28:17,054
- We have confirmation.
- Launch code confirmed.

1072
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:19,787
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, standing by.

1073
01:28:22,664 --> 01:28:24,598
Laser targeting.

1074
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:26,327
Locked on.

1075
01:28:26,401 --> 01:28:28,165
We're locked on, sir.

1076
01:28:28,236 --> 01:28:29,829
Do you wish to deploy?

1077
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:36,873
Mr President,
if you wish to deploy, the time is now.

1078
01:28:43,718 --> 01:28:45,777
- Mr President?
- Deploy.

1079
01:28:45,854 --> 01:28:48,755
That's a go.
Alpha Zulu six eight niner, deploy.

1080
01:28:48,824 --> 01:28:50,292
Here we go.

1081
01:28:58,533 --> 01:29:00,092
Bird's away.

1082
01:29:00,168 --> 01:29:03,365
We have visual confirmation of the missile.
It's on target.

1083
01:29:03,438 --> 01:29:05,668
Approaching.

1084
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,368
May our children forgive us.

1085
01:29:08,443 --> 01:29:11,708
Five seconds to impact. Three, two,

1086
01:29:11,780 --> 01:29:12,941
one.

1087
01:29:15,050 --> 01:29:16,882
Yeah! It's a hit!

1088
01:29:21,189 --> 01:29:23,817
Get down! Get down!

1089
01:29:23,892 --> 01:29:26,657
Can we confirm
that the target was destroyed?

1090
01:29:26,728 --> 01:29:29,698
Get the tank commander.
Confirm the target was destroyed.

1091
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:31,493
Yes, sir!

1092
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:34,194
Red Arrow, Alpha 9723. Can you read?

1093
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:37,330
- Repeat. You're breaking up.
- We have lost visual.

1094
01:29:37,405 --> 01:29:39,965
Roger that. We're looking for confirmation.

1095
01:29:46,648 --> 01:29:48,639
- We got the bastards.
- Yeah!

1096
01:29:48,717 --> 01:29:51,709
Good job, everyone! Congratulations.

1097
01:29:53,755 --> 01:29:57,214
Commander, do you have visual?
We need visual confirmation.

1098
01:29:57,292 --> 01:29:58,953
Has the target been destroyed?

1099
01:30:12,874 --> 01:30:14,399
Negative.

1100
01:30:16,811 --> 01:30:19,610
Target remains.

1101
01:30:21,883 --> 01:30:25,513
I repeat, target remains.

1102
01:30:28,556 --> 01:30:30,524
Call the other planes back.

1103
01:30:30,592 --> 01:30:34,426
One of the bombers might have more luck.
We shouldn't just give up on this!

1104
01:30:34,496 --> 01:30:36,828
I said call them back!

1105
01:30:39,701 --> 01:30:42,193
- Abort.
- Abort mission.

1106
01:30:42,270 --> 01:30:46,503
Issue the abort codes right away.
This is an abort, full abort. Do you read?

1107
01:31:25,046 --> 01:31:27,037
Jasmine!

1108
01:31:39,494 --> 01:31:41,462
You're late!

1109
01:31:41,529 --> 01:31:43,998
You know I like to make an entrance.

1110
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:54,965
Where are we going?

1111
01:31:55,043 --> 01:31:58,980
Mr President. Your wife is resting
comfortably for the moment.

1112
01:31:59,047 --> 01:32:03,746
- Perhaps if we had gotten to her earlier...
- Hey, there she is! Go on!

1113
01:32:05,954 --> 01:32:09,857
- She doesn't look too good.
- Your wife is bleeding internally.

1114
01:32:09,924 --> 01:32:13,519
- Perhaps if we'd gotten to her earlier...
- What are you saying?

1115
01:32:14,329 --> 01:32:16,320
We can't stop the bleeding.

1116
01:32:17,098 --> 01:32:19,089
If we'd...

1117
01:32:19,267 --> 01:32:21,668
There's nothing we can do for her.

1118
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:26,665
We were worried.
We didn't know where you were.

1119
01:32:30,311 --> 01:32:33,178
You've gotten bigger, I think.

1120
01:32:33,248 --> 01:32:35,239
1 did?

1121
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:39,250
You just keep growing and growing.

1122
01:32:41,923 --> 01:32:43,914
I can't...

1123
01:32:45,060 --> 01:32:46,687
Hey.

1124
01:32:46,761 --> 01:32:50,561
Can you wait outside for a little bit
so Mom can get a rest?

1125
01:32:51,399 --> 01:32:52,924
Hey, come on, Munchkin.

1126
01:33:02,710 --> 01:33:06,408
I'm so sorry that I didn't come home
when you asked me to.

1127
01:33:08,416 --> 01:33:10,407
It's OK.

1128
01:33:13,054 --> 01:33:15,045
The doctors...

1129
01:33:15,390 --> 01:33:17,381
think you're...

1130
01:33:17,625 --> 01:33:20,094
gonna be just fine.

1131
01:33:22,664 --> 01:33:24,655
Liar.

1132
01:34:20,655 --> 01:34:22,646
Is Mommy sleeping now?

1133
01:34:24,893 --> 01:34:26,884
Yeah.

1134
01:34:27,629 --> 01:34:29,620
Mommy's sleeping.

1135
01:34:33,101 --> 01:34:34,694
Hey.

1136
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,497
David!

1137
01:35:06,568 --> 01:35:10,163
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm makin' a mess!

1138
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:11,865
Yeah. This I can see.

1139
01:35:11,940 --> 01:35:14,705
We gotta burn this toxic waste,

1140
01:35:14,776 --> 01:35:17,108
pollute the air and rip up the ozone!

1141
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:19,840
Cos maybe if we screw
this planet up enough...

1142
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:22,477
they won't want it anymore.

1143
01:35:22,550 --> 01:35:24,541
Wait, wait, wait. David, David.

1144
01:35:24,619 --> 01:35:27,884
- Don't do this to yourself. Listen to me.
- I'm listening.

1145
01:35:27,956 --> 01:35:31,187
Everyone loses faith
at some point in their life.

1146
01:35:31,259 --> 01:35:33,523
David! Even myself.

1147
01:35:33,595 --> 01:35:37,589
I haven't spoken to God
since your mother died.

1148
01:35:43,538 --> 01:35:45,336
Sometimes

1149
01:35:45,406 --> 01:35:47,602
we have to remember what we still have.

1150
01:35:48,576 --> 01:35:50,567
Like what?

1151
01:35:53,348 --> 01:35:56,249
Well... you still have your health.

1152
01:35:58,052 --> 01:36:00,282
David, David, you need your rest.

1153
01:36:00,355 --> 01:36:04,292
Come on! Get off this freezing floor
before you catch cold. Come on!

1154
01:36:07,395 --> 01:36:09,625
- What did you just say?
- About faith?

1155
01:36:09,697 --> 01:36:12,428
- Well, you see, a man...
- No, no, no.

1156
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:17,233
- No, the other part.
- What? What? I don't want you to catch cold.

1157
01:36:22,877 --> 01:36:25,039
What is that? What is the matter with you?

1158
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,413
- Genius.
- Genius?

1159
01:36:28,483 --> 01:36:30,474
My dad. A total genius.

1160
01:36:32,487 --> 01:36:34,478
Jerry, wake up.

1161
01:36:34,555 --> 01:36:37,889
We got work to do.
Get everybody down here right away.

1162
01:36:37,959 --> 01:36:39,620
What?

1163
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,264
Look at that!

1164
01:36:43,331 --> 01:36:46,767
Wow!
Does that thing really fly in outer space?

1165
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:50,293
- It most certainly does.
- Sure doesn't look like it.

1166
01:36:50,371 --> 01:36:52,635
They're here.

1167
01:36:52,707 --> 01:36:55,335
- All right, what's this all about?
- I have no idea.

1168
01:36:55,410 --> 01:36:57,071
Get everybody off.

1169
01:36:57,145 --> 01:37:00,115
Right, everybody.
Clear the platform. Let's go.

1170
01:37:00,181 --> 01:37:01,740
Major Mitchell.

1171
01:37:01,816 --> 01:37:03,648
- Do you have a pistol?
- What?

1172
01:37:03,718 --> 01:37:06,619
- Have you got a gun?
- Sergeant, your sidearm.

1173
01:37:07,822 --> 01:37:11,452
See that, uh.... Coke can
on top of the alien craft?

1174
01:37:11,526 --> 01:37:13,494
Think you can shoot that thing off?

1175
01:37:13,561 --> 01:37:15,359
Do it. Shoot it.

1176
01:37:15,430 --> 01:37:18,456
- Sir?
- Go ahead.

1177
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:26,498
What the hell are you doing?!

1178
01:37:26,574 --> 01:37:29,043
I'm sorry. My fault, my fault.

1179
01:37:29,110 --> 01:37:32,171
That Coke can was protected
by the craft's shield.

1180
01:37:32,246 --> 01:37:34,840
- We can't penetrate it.
- We know. What's your point?

1181
01:37:34,916 --> 01:37:39,513
My point is, if we can't beat their defenses,
then we gotta get around them.

1182
01:37:39,587 --> 01:37:43,217
Major. One more time. Any time.

1183
01:37:54,469 --> 01:37:57,439
- How did you do that?
- I gave it a cold.

1184
01:37:58,906 --> 01:38:01,967
I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

1185
01:38:02,710 --> 01:38:05,077
Are you telling us you can send out a signal

1186
01:38:05,146 --> 01:38:07,205
that will disable all their shields?

1187
01:38:07,281 --> 01:38:10,581
That's right.
Just like they used our satellites against us,

1188
01:38:10,651 --> 01:38:12,813
we can use their own signal against them.

1189
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:15,879
If we plant a virus into that mother ship,

1190
01:38:15,957 --> 01:38:19,484
it's gonna filter down
into all the corresponding ships below.

1191
01:38:19,560 --> 01:38:21,494
I'm sorry. I don't understand.

1192
01:38:21,562 --> 01:38:25,829
How exactly do we infect the mother ship
with this virus?

1193
01:38:26,701 --> 01:38:29,534
We're... We're gonna...

1194
01:38:29,604 --> 01:38:34,041
have to... fly their alien craft
out of our atmosphere and dock with it.

1195
01:38:34,108 --> 01:38:35,439
We can enter here,

1196
01:38:35,510 --> 01:38:38,411
as shown in these satellite photos.

1197
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:43,144
We then upload the virus, set off
some kind of explosion which'll disable it.

1198
01:38:43,251 --> 01:38:47,950
That'll disorient the smaller ships below
and that could buy you some time to...

1199
01:38:49,257 --> 01:38:52,887
to... take ‘em... take ‘em out. Take ‘em down.

1200
01:38:52,960 --> 01:38:55,622
Do your... Do your stuff.

1201
01:38:55,696 --> 01:38:59,655
- This is ridiculous!
- How long would their shields be down?

1202
01:39:01,636 --> 01:39:03,604
I dunno. A matter of minutes.

1203
01:39:03,671 --> 01:39:05,833
You want us to coordinate

1204
01:39:05,907 --> 01:39:09,138
a worldwide counterstrike
with a window of a few minutes?

1205
01:39:09,210 --> 01:39:12,737
- With shields down, it might be possible.
- Oh, please!

1206
01:39:12,814 --> 01:39:17,047
We don't have the manpower or the resources
to launch that kind of a campaign!

1207
01:39:17,118 --> 01:39:19,712
Not to mention
that this whole cockamamie plan

1208
01:39:19,787 --> 01:39:23,746
depends on a machine that no one
in this world is qualified to operate.

1209
01:39:23,825 --> 01:39:25,816
I wouldn't say that, sir.

1210
01:39:25,893 --> 01:39:29,761
I've seen them in action.
I'm aware of their maneuvering capabilities.

1211
01:39:30,565 --> 01:39:34,001
With your permission, General,
I'd like the opportunity to try.

1212
01:39:34,068 --> 01:39:37,163
That thing is a wreck.

1213
01:39:37,238 --> 01:39:39,434
It crash-landed back in the '50s.

1214
01:39:39,507 --> 01:39:41,942
We don't even know if it's capable of flying!

1215
01:39:42,009 --> 01:39:44,341
Jim, remove the clamps.

1216
01:40:06,901 --> 01:40:08,391
Any questions?

1217
01:40:13,274 --> 01:40:15,265
Let's do it.

1218
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:20,607
All right, you heard the President...

1219
01:40:20,681 --> 01:40:23,343
- Good luck, pilot.
- Thank you, Mr President.

1220
01:40:23,951 --> 01:40:25,942
A virus.

1221
01:40:26,354 --> 01:40:28,550
Your idea.

1222
01:40:28,623 --> 01:40:30,614
That's right.

1223
01:40:36,497 --> 01:40:39,558
Do you really think you can fly that thing?

1224
01:40:39,634 --> 01:40:43,332
Do you really think
you can do all that bullshit you just said?

1225
01:40:51,546 --> 01:40:54,277
I understand you are upset
over your wife's death.

1226
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:57,215
But that's no excuse
for making another fatal mistake.

1227
01:40:57,285 --> 01:41:01,916
No, my mistake was to appoint a sniveling
weasel like you as Secretary of Defense.

1228
01:41:01,989 --> 01:41:04,458
- You don't understand!
- However...

1229
01:41:04,525 --> 01:41:08,519
that is one mistake I am thankful to say
that I don't have to live with.

1230
01:41:08,596 --> 01:41:10,587
- Mr President...
- Mr Nimsiki...

1231
01:41:10,665 --> 01:41:12,258
you're fired.

1232
01:41:15,736 --> 01:41:20,173
Let's organize every plane we can find
and get us some goddamn pilots to fly ‘em.

1233
01:41:20,241 --> 01:41:21,436
Yes, sir.

1234
01:41:21,509 --> 01:41:23,102
He can't do that.

1235
01:41:23,177 --> 01:41:26,044
Well, he just... did.

1236
01:41:29,750 --> 01:41:34,381
Command has attempted to list casualties
and losses, but information is sketchy.

1237
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:37,584
We know we've lost
the Belgian contingent in the Sinai.

1238
01:41:37,658 --> 01:41:42,152
There's a strong possibility reinforcements
are hiding in the Golan Straits.

1239
01:41:44,498 --> 01:41:48,560
- What the hell's he saying?
- They're getting a signal. Old Morse code.

1240
01:42:00,414 --> 01:42:02,405
It's from the Americans.

1241
01:42:04,785 --> 01:42:07,311
They want to organize a counteroffensive.

1242
01:42:07,388 --> 01:42:10,358
It's about bloody time!
What do they plan to do?

1243
01:42:32,580 --> 01:42:36,312
We have confirmed reports
of combat-ready divisions

1244
01:42:36,384 --> 01:42:41,185
- in Europe, the Middle East and Asia.
- Impressive. Considering it's all done with...

1245
01:42:41,255 --> 01:42:42,586
Morse code.

1246
01:42:42,657 --> 01:42:46,616
- The armed forces here?
- We have sufficient aircraft, but...

1247
01:42:46,694 --> 01:42:50,096
- But what?
- Pilots are comin' up short.

1248
01:42:50,164 --> 01:42:52,155
Well, then, find ‘em.

1249
01:42:52,233 --> 01:42:53,467
Ham radio operators from New York to Japan
trade rumors of military forces in hiding,

1250
01:42:53,467 --> 01:42:56,926
Ham radio operators from New York to Japan
trade rumors of military forces in hiding,

1251
01:42:57,004 --> 01:43:00,838
unwilling to reveal themselves
for fear of annihilation...

1252
01:43:02,176 --> 01:43:04,838
We're planning to launch a counteroffensive.

1253
01:43:04,912 --> 01:43:06,471
With our depleted manpower,

1254
01:43:06,547 --> 01:43:10,040
we're asking that anyone with
flight experience come forward.

1255
01:43:10,117 --> 01:43:13,747
Military training is preferable,
but anyone who can fly would help.

1256
01:43:15,089 --> 01:43:16,750
I can fly.

1257
01:43:16,824 --> 01:43:18,383
I'm a pilot.

1258
01:43:20,861 --> 01:43:22,886
All right, guys! Listen up!

1259
01:43:22,963 --> 01:43:26,900
Pay attention. These F-18s are
very different than the jets you piloted.

1260
01:43:26,967 --> 01:43:29,163
- It's strong.
- Forgive the expression,

1261
01:43:29,236 --> 01:43:32,206
but this is a crash course in modern avionics.

1262
01:43:32,273 --> 01:43:34,742
- Keep it comin'.
- OK, you got it!

1263
01:43:34,809 --> 01:43:37,210
All right, listen up. Before we can begin,

1264
01:43:37,278 --> 01:43:40,339
we need some background information
on your experience.

1265
01:43:40,414 --> 01:43:42,405
Let's start with you.

1266
01:43:42,483 --> 01:43:44,110
Who, me?

1267
01:43:45,786 --> 01:43:48,153
Well, I'm Russell Casse, sir.

1268
01:43:49,590 --> 01:43:53,584
And, uh... after 'Nam,
I got into crop-dusting.

1269
01:43:54,729 --> 01:43:57,562
And, uh... been doing that ever since.

1270
01:43:57,631 --> 01:44:02,159
On a personal note, sir,
I'd just like to add that, uh...

1271
01:44:03,003 --> 01:44:08,840
ever since I was kidnapped by aliens 10 years
ago, I have been dyin' for some payback.

1272
01:44:08,909 --> 01:44:12,903
I just want you to know that...
I won't let you down.

1273
01:44:14,081 --> 01:44:16,573
You have one tactical nuclear missile

1274
01:44:16,650 --> 01:44:20,086
we're loading into this launcher
under the right wing.

1275
01:44:20,154 --> 01:44:22,122
This is the firing mechanism.

1276
01:44:22,189 --> 01:44:25,454
It'll be attached to the ship's main console.

1277
01:44:25,526 --> 01:44:27,893
Just like the Amraam launch pad
on a Stealth.

1278
01:44:27,962 --> 01:44:30,590
Except the nuke will not detonate at impact.

1279
01:44:30,664 --> 01:44:33,793
You'll have 30 seconds
to get your asses out of there.

1280
01:44:34,802 --> 01:44:36,395
Good luck, gentlemen.

1281
01:44:36,470 --> 01:44:38,461
30 seconds.

1282
01:44:38,539 --> 01:44:43,306
It's the strongest radio transmitter we had.
It'll tell us when you've uploaded the virus.

1283
01:44:43,377 --> 01:44:46,278
30 seconds. Don't you think
that's cutting it too close?

1284
01:44:46,347 --> 01:44:50,648
We're gonna be well on our way back home
before we shoot that thing off.

1285
01:44:51,919 --> 01:44:54,217
Why you? David!

1286
01:44:54,288 --> 01:44:56,882
I don't understand...

1287
01:44:56,957 --> 01:45:00,552
why you can't show
someone else how to plant the virus.

1288
01:45:00,628 --> 01:45:02,619
No, no. Something may go wrong.

1289
01:45:02,696 --> 01:45:05,563
I may have to think quickly,
adjust the signal.

1290
01:45:05,633 --> 01:45:09,365
Who knows? Hey, you know how
I'm always trying to save the planet?

1291
01:45:14,308 --> 01:45:16,299
Here's my chance.

1292
01:45:18,712 --> 01:45:20,737
Now he gets ambitious.

1293
01:45:20,815 --> 01:45:24,115
- It's too tight.
- Well, I had to borrow it. Let me see.

1294
01:45:24,185 --> 01:45:26,984
OK. All right, I guess that's good enough.

1295
01:45:27,054 --> 01:45:29,113
So. How do I look?

1296
01:45:30,391 --> 01:45:32,587
Oh, thank you. You're a lot of help.

1297
01:45:35,663 --> 01:45:37,859
- You're late!
- Well, you know me.

1298
01:45:37,932 --> 01:45:40,663
I know. You like to make a big entrance.

1299
01:45:41,936 --> 01:45:45,736
Listen. Before we do this,
I just wanna say I'm sorry.

1300
01:45:45,806 --> 01:45:47,797
Sorry for what, babe?

1301
01:45:48,576 --> 01:45:51,307
I should have done this a long time ago.

1302
01:45:51,846 --> 01:45:54,713
- Do you have the ring?
- Yes, sir.

1303
01:45:55,349 --> 01:45:58,319
- Here, make yourself useful.
- ow!

1304
01:45:59,820 --> 01:46:01,811
Witnesses?

1305
01:46:04,024 --> 01:46:05,753
We got hung up.

1306
01:46:05,826 --> 01:46:08,352
Let's get this show on the road.

1307
01:46:08,429 --> 01:46:12,457
Dearly beloved,
we're gathered here in the sight of God

1308
01:46:12,533 --> 01:46:15,833
and in the presence of these witnesses

1309
01:46:15,903 --> 01:46:18,895
to join this man and this woman
in holy matrimony.

1310
01:46:18,973 --> 01:46:23,035
Any person who can show good cause
why these two should not wed,

1311
01:46:24,144 --> 01:46:27,136
please speak now or forever hold your peace.

1312
01:46:29,149 --> 01:46:32,710
Steve, will you take this woman
to be your wedded wife,

1313
01:46:32,786 --> 01:46:35,915
to live together with her
in the holy state of matrimony?

1314
01:46:35,990 --> 01:46:41,588
Will you love her, comfort her, honor
and keep her in sickness and in health,

1315
01:46:41,662 --> 01:46:44,029
and, forsaking all others,

1316
01:46:44,098 --> 01:46:48,092
keep yourself only for her
as long as you both shall live?

1317
01:46:48,168 --> 01:46:50,159
1 will.

1318
01:47:02,016 --> 01:47:04,007
Good morning.

1319
01:47:07,821 --> 01:47:10,017
They're a little young.

1320
01:47:10,157 --> 01:47:12,489
That they are.

1321
01:47:13,994 --> 01:47:16,395
They look a little nervous.

1322
01:47:16,463 --> 01:47:20,093
I need all flight crews
to report to their designated areas.

1323
01:47:20,768 --> 01:47:23,430
- Major. Can I borrow that?
- Sir.

1324
01:47:25,439 --> 01:47:27,430
Good morning.

1325
01:47:29,143 --> 01:47:31,134
Good morning.

1326
01:47:32,179 --> 01:47:33,738
In less than an hour,

1327
01:47:33,814 --> 01:47:38,513
aircraft from here
will join others from around the world.

1328
01:47:39,853 --> 01:47:44,450
And you will be launching the largest
aerial battle in the history of mankind.

1329
01:47:47,728 --> 01:47:49,696
Mankind.

1330
01:47:49,763 --> 01:47:53,427
That word should have
new meaning for all of us today.

1331
01:47:53,500 --> 01:47:57,368
We can't be consumed
by our petty differences anymore.

1332
01:47:59,039 --> 01:48:02,031
We will be united in our common interest.

1333
01:48:03,377 --> 01:48:06,972
Perhaps it's fate
that today is the Fourth of July.

1334
01:48:08,115 --> 01:48:11,779
And you will once again
be fighting for our freedom.

1335
01:48:12,653 --> 01:48:15,987
Not from tyranny, oppression or persecution.

1336
01:48:18,292 --> 01:48:20,283
But from annihilation.

1337
01:48:21,495 --> 01:48:23,896
We're fighting for our right to live.

1338
01:48:25,532 --> 01:48:27,000
To exist.

1339
01:48:28,669 --> 01:48:30,660
And should we win the day,

1340
01:48:31,005 --> 01:48:35,306
the Fourth of July will no longer
be known as an American holiday,

1341
01:48:36,510 --> 01:48:39,605
but as the day
when the world declared in one voice,

1342
01:48:39,680 --> 01:48:42,206
"We will not go quietly into the night!"

1343
01:48:42,282 --> 01:48:46,082
"We will not vanish without a fight!"

1344
01:48:47,021 --> 01:48:49,046
"We're going to live on!"

1345
01:48:49,123 --> 01:48:51,114
"We're going to survive!"

1346
01:48:52,226 --> 01:48:56,663
Today, we celebrate our Independence Day!

1347
01:49:21,555 --> 01:49:24,547
- Let's go!
- Mr President. Right this way, sir.

1348
01:49:24,825 --> 01:49:27,089
- I've got your gear over here.
- Good luck!

1349
01:49:27,161 --> 01:49:31,394
I've got you a jumpsuit and your gear is here.
You've got your choice of helmets.

1350
01:49:33,901 --> 01:49:37,098
Mr President,
I'd sure like to know what you're doing.

1351
01:49:37,171 --> 01:49:39,265
I'm a combat pilot, Will.

1352
01:49:41,608 --> 01:49:43,804
I belong in the air.

1353
01:49:50,184 --> 01:49:52,676
OK, sir. Let's get you airborne.

1354
01:49:55,789 --> 01:49:59,419
As soon as I get back,
we're gonna light those fireworks, right?

1355
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:09,900
Here. Take these.

1356
01:50:12,773 --> 01:50:14,741
Just in case.

1357
01:50:14,808 --> 01:50:16,503
Where's... Where's...

1358
01:50:27,354 --> 01:50:29,345
Just in case.

1359
01:50:31,658 --> 01:50:33,649
I'm very proud of you.

1360
01:50:45,672 --> 01:50:47,663
Be careful, OK?

1361
01:50:53,881 --> 01:50:55,542
It's time.

1362
01:51:09,329 --> 01:51:12,060
Oh, damn! Wait a minute, wait a minute.

1363
01:51:12,132 --> 01:51:14,999
- We gotta find some cigars. I can't...
- Here! Here!

1364
01:51:15,068 --> 01:51:17,059
Take these. My last two.

1365
01:51:17,671 --> 01:51:19,662
You are a lifesaver.

1366
01:51:20,407 --> 01:51:23,001
Almost put a hex on the whole damn thing!

1367
01:51:51,038 --> 01:51:53,302
- Missile launch.
- Oh, crap!

1368
01:51:53,373 --> 01:51:55,569
What do I hit? Which one?

1369
01:51:58,045 --> 01:52:00,537
I picked a hell of a day to quit drinkin'.

1370
01:52:15,729 --> 01:52:18,221
This is our victory dance.

1371
01:52:18,298 --> 01:52:20,357
Not until the fat lady sings.

1372
01:52:20,434 --> 01:52:23,028
Oh. Yes, OK.

1373
01:52:23,103 --> 01:52:24,571
This is important.

1374
01:52:24,638 --> 01:52:27,266
Fat lady. I gotcha.

1375
01:52:29,076 --> 01:52:31,238
Open launch tunnel.

1376
01:52:50,564 --> 01:52:53,625
Shaky, huh?
Is it gonna do this the whole way?

1377
01:52:53,700 --> 01:52:56,692
Make sure your seat backs
are in their upright position.

1378
01:52:56,770 --> 01:52:58,101
Yeah. Is it?

1379
01:53:01,775 --> 01:53:03,971
Let's rock'n'roll.

1380
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:10,978
Oops.

1381
01:53:11,051 --> 01:53:13,383
Oops? What does that mean?

1382
01:53:13,453 --> 01:53:16,787
No, I got it.
Some jerk didn't put the thing...

1383
01:53:16,857 --> 01:53:19,383
What do you mean, saying "oops" there?

1384
01:53:19,459 --> 01:53:21,951
What do you say we try that one again, huh?

1385
01:53:22,029 --> 01:53:24,498
Yes, yes. Yes, without the "oops".

1386
01:53:25,332 --> 01:53:26,663
Thataway!

1387
01:53:33,674 --> 01:53:35,972
I have got to get me one of these!

1388
01:53:44,885 --> 01:53:49,516
- No, no. What was that? Don't do that!
- Just tryin' to get a feel for the old girl.

1389
01:53:49,589 --> 01:53:51,421
No, no, don't. Leave her alone.

1390
01:53:51,491 --> 01:53:53,983
- Look, no hands!
- Steve!

1391
01:53:57,898 --> 01:54:01,095
- You're all secure, sir.
- Grey, do you read me?

1392
01:54:01,168 --> 01:54:04,502
Roger, Eagle One.
Your primary target has shifted course.

1393
01:54:04,571 --> 01:54:07,472
- Which way they headed?
- I think our secret's out.

1394
01:54:07,541 --> 01:54:09,373
They're headed straight for us.

1395
01:54:09,443 --> 01:54:12,003
ETA, 26 minutes.

1396
01:54:15,048 --> 01:54:17,016
You still with me over there?

1397
01:54:17,084 --> 01:54:19,382
What the hell was I thinking?

1398
01:54:30,364 --> 01:54:33,197
I've been waiting for this my whole life.

1399
01:54:44,711 --> 01:54:46,941
Head straight for it.

1400
01:54:51,885 --> 01:54:54,855
- What the hell...?
- Don't touch ‘em. Don't, don't!

1401
01:54:54,921 --> 01:54:56,912
I was counting on this.

1402
01:54:56,990 --> 01:54:58,981
They are bringing us in.

1403
01:55:00,093 --> 01:55:03,893
- When the hell was you gonna tell me?
- Oops.

1404
01:55:06,032 --> 01:55:08,399
We've got to work on our communication.

1405
01:55:23,550 --> 01:55:25,541
We have visual.

1406
01:55:25,619 --> 01:55:27,849
Do not engage until we've confirmed

1407
01:55:27,921 --> 01:55:30,083
- the package has been delivered.
- Roger.

1408
01:55:35,462 --> 01:55:38,523
Major, what happens if that thing gets here

1409
01:55:38,598 --> 01:55:40,589
before the virus is planted?

1410
01:55:40,667 --> 01:55:43,500
This facility's buried
deep within a mountain.

1411
01:55:43,570 --> 01:55:46,801
- It should provide us some protection.
- Great.

1412
01:55:46,873 --> 01:55:49,240
What about the people outside?

1413
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:58,817
Lieutenant Sell? We got incoming.

1414
01:56:57,577 --> 01:56:59,568
Oh, my God.

1415
01:57:32,746 --> 01:57:34,214
Look at that.

1416
01:57:44,057 --> 01:57:45,991
There must be thousands of ‘em.

1417
01:57:46,059 --> 01:57:48,721
Millions of ‘em. What the hell are they doing?

1418
01:57:49,296 --> 01:57:51,890
Looks like they're preparing an invasion.

1419
01:58:19,426 --> 01:58:22,418
Hey, I don't like this!
This is stupid. They can see us.

1420
01:58:22,495 --> 01:58:24,520
No, no. This thing comes fully loaded.

1421
01:58:24,598 --> 01:58:27,568
AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats and...

1422
01:58:27,634 --> 01:58:29,659
power windows.

1423
01:58:43,583 --> 01:58:45,108
Come on, baby.

1424
01:58:45,452 --> 01:58:47,045
Come on, baby.

1425
01:58:49,689 --> 01:58:51,589
We're in.

1426
01:58:56,796 --> 01:58:58,594
Do it. Do it.

1427
01:58:58,665 --> 01:59:00,133
Do it.

1428
01:59:00,200 --> 01:59:02,396
Sir, he's uploading the virus.

1429
01:59:02,469 --> 01:59:04,801
Eagle One, the package is being delivered.

1430
01:59:04,871 --> 01:59:06,965
Stand by to engage.

1431
01:59:08,341 --> 01:59:10,435
Roger. Eagle One, check left.

1432
01:59:14,714 --> 01:59:17,183
Listen up! We have an emergency situation.

1433
01:59:17,250 --> 01:59:19,412
We need you to grab everything you can.

1434
01:59:19,486 --> 01:59:23,354
Only what you can carry.
We need to get you inside immediately.

1435
01:59:26,660 --> 01:59:28,094
The virus is in.

1436
01:59:33,967 --> 01:59:36,800
All we can do now is... pray.

1437
01:59:38,171 --> 01:59:41,573
- Delivery complete. Engage.
- Delivery complete. It's a go!

1438
01:59:41,641 --> 01:59:43,973
Eagle One. Fox three.

1439
01:59:48,048 --> 01:59:49,812
Gentlemen, this is it.

1440
01:59:53,186 --> 01:59:54,984
Come on, come on, come on.

1441
02:00:07,934 --> 02:00:09,834
Virus ineffective. Disengage.

1442
02:00:09,903 --> 02:00:11,871
- Get your people out.
- Disengage.

1443
02:00:11,938 --> 02:00:13,929
Right flank, follow suit.

1444
02:00:15,408 --> 02:00:17,399
Hold on, Command.

1445
02:00:18,044 --> 02:00:21,571
- I want another shot at it.
- Sir, I strongly recommend you disengage.

1446
02:00:21,648 --> 02:00:25,243
Eagle One. Fox three.

1447
02:00:39,299 --> 02:00:42,269
- Direct hit!
- It's a hit! Squadron leaders, fire at will!

1448
02:00:42,335 --> 02:00:43,803
Fire at will!

1449
02:00:43,870 --> 02:00:46,771
We're going in. Squadron leaders, take flight.

1450
02:00:48,274 --> 02:00:50,174
- Eagle Six at seven.
- Eagle Five at three.

1451
02:00:50,243 --> 02:00:52,268
Eagle One. Fox two.

1452
02:00:52,345 --> 02:00:53,835
Eagle Twenty! Fox two!

1453
02:01:02,789 --> 02:01:05,918
Evasive maneuvers!
Squadron leaders, evasive maneuvers!

1454
02:01:06,760 --> 02:01:08,250
Prepare to engage!

1455
02:01:13,233 --> 02:01:16,601
All right, Mr President! Here we go!

1456
02:01:16,669 --> 02:01:18,728
All right, baby. I've gotcha!

1457
02:01:20,774 --> 02:01:23,072
Payback's a bitch, ain't it?

1458
02:01:24,978 --> 02:01:25,879
OK. Job's done. Let's go home.

1459
02:01:25,879 --> 02:01:27,278
OK. Job's done. Let's go home.

1460
02:01:27,847 --> 02:01:29,212
Gladly.

1461
02:01:32,952 --> 02:01:34,147
What's up?

1462
02:01:34,220 --> 02:01:35,949
It's stuck.

1463
02:01:36,022 --> 02:01:38,218
- What?
- It's not responding. It's stuck.

1464
02:01:38,291 --> 02:01:39,588
Then try again.

1465
02:01:54,440 --> 02:01:56,272
Come on, come on!

1466
02:02:12,959 --> 02:02:14,893
Come on, come on! Inside!

1467
02:02:14,961 --> 02:02:16,952
Go to the elevator!

1468
02:02:29,008 --> 02:02:30,703
Steve! Steve!

1469
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:39,216
- What are you doin'?
- They're overriding the system.

1470
02:02:39,986 --> 02:02:41,647
Oh, shit!

1471
02:02:42,522 --> 02:02:43,717
Hide.

1472
02:02:49,762 --> 02:02:52,163
Everybody hold someone's hand.
Hold hands.

1473
02:02:53,233 --> 02:02:54,394
Come on in.

1474
02:02:58,137 --> 02:02:59,536
I'm not Jewish.

1475
02:03:00,073 --> 02:03:01,837
Nobody's perfect.

1476
02:03:04,143 --> 02:03:06,043
Are you scared?

1477
02:03:07,046 --> 02:03:08,036
Me, too.

1478
02:03:09,849 --> 02:03:12,113
Eagle Seven, fox two.

1479
02:03:12,185 --> 02:03:14,517
Eagle Three, fox two.

1480
02:03:19,859 --> 02:03:23,523
We're running out of missiles, sir.
We're not causing enough damage.

1481
02:03:23,596 --> 02:03:25,223
It's directly over us.

1482
02:03:34,407 --> 02:03:36,808
They're preparing to fire
their primary weapon.

1483
02:03:36,876 --> 02:03:39,106
Then let's take it out before it takes us out.

1484
02:03:44,817 --> 02:03:46,285
Target at 12 o'clock!

1485
02:03:48,821 --> 02:03:50,414
My God! They're everywhere!

1486
02:03:51,824 --> 02:03:54,350
- Bandits on our tail! Locked on!
- I see 'em.

1487
02:03:57,730 --> 02:04:00,028
Squadron leaders, I want a weapons check!

1488
02:04:01,668 --> 02:04:04,262
You're outta time!
You've gotta disable it now!

1489
02:04:07,640 --> 02:04:10,666
I'm in range. Locking on.

1490
02:04:10,743 --> 02:04:11,835
I've got tone.

1491
02:04:11,911 --> 02:04:13,379
Eagle One, fox two!

1492
02:04:23,089 --> 02:04:24,853
That is a negative impact.

1493
02:04:24,924 --> 02:04:27,052
That is an NI. Negative impact.

1494
02:04:27,126 --> 02:04:30,118
I'm out of missiles. Eagle Two!

1495
02:04:30,196 --> 02:04:31,686
I'm on it.

1496
02:04:33,900 --> 02:04:35,834
Oh, Jesus!

1497
02:04:38,171 --> 02:04:41,766
- Sir, all missiles have been fired.
- Outta time! Get your ass outta there!

1498
02:04:41,841 --> 02:04:44,333
- We're not done yet!
- Get as far away as you can!

1499
02:04:44,410 --> 02:04:48,643
- Doesn't anyone have any missiles left?
- Sorry I'm late, Mr President!

1500
02:04:52,452 --> 02:04:53,851
I got hung up back there!

1501
02:04:53,920 --> 02:04:57,322
- Pilot, you armed?
- Armed and ready, sir!

1502
02:04:57,390 --> 02:04:58,949
I'm packin'!

1503
02:05:00,360 --> 02:05:02,089
- Who is that guy?
- Put him on speaker.

1504
02:05:02,161 --> 02:05:04,960
- Pilot, identify yourself.
- It's me!

1505
02:05:05,031 --> 02:05:06,692
Russell Casse, sir.

1506
02:05:07,533 --> 02:05:09,524
I told you I wouldn't let you down!

1507
02:05:09,602 --> 02:05:12,799
Just keep those guys off me
for a few more seconds, will ya?

1508
02:05:12,872 --> 02:05:18,003
OK. Echo Niner, Echo Seven, take
flanking positions. Look after this guy, OK?

1509
02:05:18,444 --> 02:05:21,505
All right, boys.
Let's give Mr Casse some cover!

1510
02:05:22,648 --> 02:05:24,946
Gentlemen! Let's plow the road!

1511
02:05:32,859 --> 02:05:34,827
We'll draw them off and it's all yours!

1512
02:05:35,962 --> 02:05:37,953
Look out! Comin' through!

1513
02:05:39,699 --> 02:05:41,133
I've got tone.

1514
02:05:43,236 --> 02:05:45,796
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1515
02:05:52,912 --> 02:05:54,812
Eagle Twenty. Fox two.

1516
02:05:57,417 --> 02:05:59,511
It's jammed.

1517
02:06:00,553 --> 02:06:02,317
It won't fire.

1518
02:06:05,425 --> 02:06:06,893
Dammit!

1519
02:06:17,336 --> 02:06:19,327
Do me a favor.

1520
02:06:21,441 --> 02:06:25,344
Tell my children I love them very much.

1521
02:06:28,514 --> 02:06:30,744
All right, you alien assholes!

1522
02:06:31,684 --> 02:06:34,415
In the words of my generation...

1523
02:06:34,487 --> 02:06:38,515
up yours!

1524
02:06:38,591 --> 02:06:40,582
Dad! What's he doing?

1525
02:06:40,660 --> 02:06:41,855
Come on, baby!

1526
02:06:41,928 --> 02:06:43,919
Come on, baby, come on!

1527
02:06:47,066 --> 02:06:48,534
Good luck, buddy.

1528
02:06:57,243 --> 02:07:01,202
Hello, boys! I'm back!

1529
02:07:22,168 --> 02:07:23,602
He did it!

1530
02:07:23,669 --> 02:07:26,229
The son of a bitch did it!

1531
02:07:29,242 --> 02:07:30,403
All right!

1532
02:07:52,899 --> 02:07:54,993
What your father did was very brave.

1533
02:07:56,802 --> 02:07:58,668
You should be proud of him.

1534
02:07:59,305 --> 02:08:01,296
I am.

1535
02:08:18,658 --> 02:08:22,891
We know how to take 'em out, General.
Spread the word.

1536
02:08:25,798 --> 02:08:29,234
Get on the wire to every squadron
around the world.

1537
02:08:29,302 --> 02:08:32,704
Tell them how to bring
those sons of bitches down.

1538
02:08:46,419 --> 02:08:47,978
What do you think?

1539
02:08:49,922 --> 02:08:51,412
Checkmate.

1540
02:09:16,849 --> 02:09:20,342
Well, it's funny. I always thought
things like these would kill me.

1541
02:09:34,066 --> 02:09:35,465
It's been a pleasure.

1542
02:09:36,702 --> 02:09:38,363
Steve, you too.

1543
02:09:42,275 --> 02:09:44,266
Only one thing left to do.

1544
02:09:50,549 --> 02:09:51,778
Right.

1545
02:09:51,851 --> 02:09:53,046
Yes, sir.

1546
02:09:59,992 --> 02:10:03,155
- Hey, all right!
- Look at us.

1547
02:10:03,229 --> 02:10:06,665
Take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye!

1548
02:10:06,732 --> 02:10:09,793
- Y'all take care. Nothing but love for ya!
- Goodbye!

1549
02:10:11,671 --> 02:10:14,038
Do you think they know
what's about to happen?

1550
02:10:14,106 --> 02:10:16,507
Oh, not a chance in hell. Good night!

1551
02:10:23,683 --> 02:10:24,741
Peace!

1552
02:10:38,364 --> 02:10:41,265
We're loose.
Can you get us outta here in 30 seconds?

1553
02:10:41,334 --> 02:10:42,961
I ain't heard no fat lady!

1554
02:10:43,035 --> 02:10:45,367
Forget the fat lady.
Drive us outta here!

1555
02:10:53,346 --> 02:10:55,781
- They're chasing us.
- Oh, really. You think?

1556
02:11:04,223 --> 02:11:07,989
- Oh, that was a hit. I took a hit.
- We're not hit! Stop back-seat driving!

1557
02:11:11,831 --> 02:11:14,198
Left, left! Tunnel, tunnel! Exit left!

1558
02:11:14,266 --> 02:11:17,167
- Where the hell do you think I'm goin'?
- OK, OK. We're...

1559
02:11:35,921 --> 02:11:38,253
- They're closing up on us.
- Shut up, shut up!

1560
02:11:38,324 --> 02:11:41,817
Go faster, must go faster, must go faster.
Go, go, go, go, go!

1561
02:11:54,807 --> 02:11:57,003
Elvis has left the building!

1562
02:11:57,076 --> 02:11:58,805
Oh, thank you very much.

1563
02:11:58,878 --> 02:12:00,812
Oh, I love you, man.

1564
02:13:32,304 --> 02:13:35,604
They're goin' down all over the world, Tom.
We got ‘em beat.

1565
02:13:35,674 --> 02:13:38,575
How about our two delivery boys?
Any word from them?

1566
02:13:42,348 --> 02:13:47,377
We lost contact with Captain Hiller
and Levinson nearly 20 minutes ago.

1567
02:13:50,656 --> 02:13:51,646
Hold it!

1568
02:13:52,291 --> 02:13:54,623
Hold on, sir. I've got something on radar.

1569
02:14:42,575 --> 02:14:44,100
Sorry, sir.

1570
