Huh...

321
00:30:46,578 --> 00:30:48,945
Well, we orphans should stick together,
don't you think?

322
00:30:49,114 --> 00:30:53,210
I'm really sorry. It's my fault,
getting you mixed up in all of this.

323
00:30:53,385 --> 00:30:54,409
Are you kidding?

324
00:30:54,586 --> 00:30:56,554
This is the most exciting thing
that's ever happened to me.

325
00:30:56,922 --> 00:30:59,323
I wouldn't miss an adventure
like this for anything in the world.

- (GASPS) Wha...
- (GASPS)

328
00:31:13,572 --> 00:31:16,564
Are you some sort of goblin
come to torment me?

329
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:20,435
It's Uncle Pom. Don't worry,
he's a friend. Uncle Pom!

330
00:31:21,146 --> 00:31:23,114
Uncle Pom! Boy, am I glad to see you.

331
00:31:23,348 --> 00:31:27,410
I can't see you clearly yet,
goblin, but you sound like Pazu.

332
00:31:27,586 --> 00:31:31,523
And if these old eyes don't deceive me,
there's a she-goblin with you.

333
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:33,483
There are pirates chasing us,
Uncle Pom.

334
00:31:33,658 --> 00:31:36,457
- Oh!
- And the army's right behind them.

335
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,861
(LAUGHS)
That sounds absolutely splendid.

336
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:55,242
-The tea is ready. Help yourself.
-Thank you. This is great.

337
00:31:55,414 --> 00:31:58,475
Don't you get lonely
down here underground, Uncle Pom?

338
00:31:59,918 --> 00:32:05,118
Never, my dear. All of these rocks
are my friends, they often talk to me.

339
00:32:05,390 --> 00:32:08,883
Ever since last night,
they've been especially restless.

340
00:32:09,060 --> 00:32:11,358
-The rocks talk to you?
- Oh, yes, Pazu.

341
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,362
The earth speaks to all of us.

342
00:32:13,532 --> 00:32:16,024
And if we listen, we can understand.

343
00:32:21,640 --> 00:32:24,905
The rocks speak in a very small voice.

344
00:32:36,054 --> 00:32:37,488
Huh?

345
00:32:38,156 --> 00:32:39,453
Oh, my.

346
00:32:58,009 --> 00:33:01,468
- Amazing.
- Pazu, look above us.

347
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,478
Huh? Wow!

348
00:33:13,725 --> 00:33:16,353
It was just
a hunk of rock a while ago.

349
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:18,087
Oh, my!

350
00:33:18,263 --> 00:33:22,598
The answer lies inside these rocks.
Let me show you.

351
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:26,433
Wow.

352
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,232
Pazu, you see?

353
00:33:32,477 --> 00:33:36,380
All the rocks around here
contain a bit of etherium.

354
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:37,674
Really?

355
00:33:39,651 --> 00:33:45,522
Mankind once knew
how to mine etherium, but no longer.

356
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:48,987
Wait.

357
00:33:49,594 --> 00:33:51,494
Look, my stone's glowing...

358
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,195
Well, goodness bless my soul!
That's a pure etherium crystal.

359
00:33:57,569 --> 00:34:01,096
There hasn't been one since before
my great grandfather's time.

360
00:34:03,241 --> 00:34:06,233
No wonder the rocks were restless.

361
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,741
This stone possesses
incredible power.

362
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:14,081
Legend has it that only the people
of the floating city of Laputa

363
00:34:14,252 --> 00:34:15,583
knew how to make such crystals.

364
00:34:16,087 --> 00:34:17,612
They made this crystal?

365
00:34:17,789 --> 00:34:21,555
They used etherium
to make Laputa float in the sky.

366
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:24,593
I knew Laputa wasn't just made up.
You see, Sheeta?

367
00:34:24,763 --> 00:34:26,629
It's just like my dad said!

I'm sorry, but would you put that
crystal away? It's too strong for me.

{SIGHING)

Great-grandpa used to tell me

375
00:34:56,328 --> 00:35:01,459
that the rocks become restless
when Laputa appears over the mine.

376
00:35:01,633 --> 00:35:04,227
Wow! So that must mean
Laputa's over the mine right now!

377
00:35:04,402 --> 00:35:07,235
Listen! Sheeta, now I can prove
that the legend is true!

378
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,671
- Sheeta, I must tell you something.
-Yes, what is it?

379
00:35:15,113 --> 00:35:18,208
That crystal is extremely powerful,

380
00:35:18,383 --> 00:35:23,150
but with a power that rightfully belongs
to the earth from which it came.

381
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:27,758
To forget that and then to try and use
the crystal's power for selfish reasons,

382
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:30,185
will bring great unhappiness.
You understand?

383
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,295
Yes.

384
00:35:32,163 --> 00:35:35,622
Your crystal should remind us
that we come from the earth,

385
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,201
and to the earth we must return.

386
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,194
Come on! Lighten up!

387
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,308
Two times already that crystals gotten
Sheeta out of some really big trouble.

388
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:48,302
And I have a feeling that crystal's
gonna help us find Laputa.

389
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,355
It's flying away.

390

Mom, can we
go back to the ship now, please?

391
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:02,122
It's too quiet.

392
00:36:02,293 --> 00:36:03,886
We'd better just stay put
for the time being.

that no one here on Earth
believes exists.

But I swear,
I am gonna be the one to prove it.

I haven't told you yet.

has a very old traditional name,

and when the stone was passed
on to me, I inherited that name.

was LucitaToelle Ur Laputa.

the same technology
that kept Laputa airborne

also made it a major power
that once dominated the entire planet.

Yes, I'm sure I could see
the sun rising from the tower.

You know,
it's the end of grass-cutting season,

726
01:08:03,313 --> 01:08:06,806
so the sun rose not from due east,
but a little further south.

727
01:08:07,183 --> 01:08:10,084

of the hill from which the sun rose.

-You see?
- Pretty smart.

- Found anything yet?
- Haven't found a single thing, Captain.

can't find them, those flying devils.

when they're faster than we are?

Well, it looks like we're cruising
on the windward side of ‘em.

So if we manage to ride the trade wind...

Let's see,
according to my calculations...

With wind velocity at 10...

01:08:34,243 --> 01:08:35,802

Goliath is already underway for Laputa.

01:08:43,620 --> 01:08:45,850
We're gonna set sail and go after ‘em.

740
01:08:46,222 --> 01:08:49,192
If we can catch the wind,
we'll be on their heels by tomorrow.

Now, the first man to spy Goliath
will receive 10 gold coins.

01:12:55,538 --> 01:12:57,700
Does anyone want anymore?

787
01:12:57,874 --> 01:12:59,103
I do believe I will have a second helping.

788
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:00,943
-Yes? Oh!
- I want some more!

789
01:13:13,122 --> 01:13:14,886
(SNORING)

790
01:13:19,929 --> 01:13:21,590
Come oh, young pup.

791
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:28,036
Time to go on duty.
It's cold, take this.

792
01:13:30,506 --> 01:13:31,473
Huh?

793
01:13:45,888 --> 01:13:48,414
- I'll take over.
-Thank you.

794
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:02,871
Sheeta.

795
01:14:05,207 --> 01:14:06,402
Whoa!

796
01:14:07,543 --> 01:14:11,446
That was exciting!
Wow, you can see forever.

797
01:14:23,893 --> 01:14:25,190
Sheeta. Here.

798
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:31,966
- (PAZUTHROUGH PIPE) You okay?
-That's better.

799
01:14:34,570 --> 01:14:36,937
{PAZUTHROUGH PIPE) This is great.
Now we can keep watch together.

800
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,703
- Pazw?
- Hmm?

801
01:14:42,545 --> 01:14:44,513
I'm really scared.

802
01:14:45,181 --> 01:14:48,583
(SHEETATHROUGH PIPE} To tell you
the truth, I don't want to go to Laputa.

803
01:14:49,118 --> 01:14:50,142
{PAZUTHROUGH PIPE)
What do you mean?

804
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:52,920
Didn't you tell Dola the truth?

805
01:14:53,089 --> 01:14:57,583
SHEETA: I didn't lie to Dola. What I said
about the light's direction is true.

806
01:14:57,760 --> 01:15:00,058
But what if someone else dies?

807
01:15:00,229 --> 01:15:01,856
PAZU:You mean, like the robot?

808
01:15:02,031 --> 01:15:06,025
SHEETA: He died to save my life.
I feel awful.

809
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:09,228
All this is because of a spell
my grandmother taught me.

810
01:15:09,605 --> 01:15:12,199
She taught me all sorts of spells.

811
01:15:12,575 --> 01:15:16,910
A spell to use when you're looking
for something, a spell to cure sickness.

812
01:15:17,079 --> 01:15:20,049
There's even one she told me
I must never use.

813
01:15:20,216 --> 01:15:23,242
- PAZU: What kind of spell?
- SHEETA: The spell of destruction.

814
01:15:23,619 --> 01:15:25,644
She said that
to give power to good spells,

815
01:15:25,821 --> 01:15:27,255
I had to know the evil ones too.

816
01:15:27,623 --> 01:15:29,955
But she told me never to use them.

817
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:33,994
I was so scared when I learned
that spell, I couldn't sleep.

818
01:15:34,196 --> 01:15:37,063
I didn't know the spells
were connected to my necklace.

819
01:15:37,233 --> 01:15:39,065
Uncle Pom was right when he said

820
01:15:39,235 --> 01:15:42,569
that it was dangerous for us
to misuse the power of the crystal.

821
01:15:43,172 --> 01:15:45,163
SHEETA: And what if Laputa
has the same power

822
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,010
that can also be used for great evil?

823
01:15:48,177 --> 01:15:51,112
I wish I'd thrown the crystal away.

824
01:15:51,280 --> 01:15:52,543
But then we never would have met.

825
01:15:52,715 --> 01:15:55,741
And anyway, even if you had,
Laputa would still exist.

826
01:15:56,018 --> 01:15:59,113
Airplanes and flying machines
are getting better and better.

827
01:15:59,288 --> 01:16:01,518
You know eventually
some explorer or another

828
01:16:01,690 --> 01:16:04,091
will come across the city of Laputa
one day and claim it.

829
01:16:05,561 --> 01:16:06,995
PAZU: I can't say I know what's best,

830
01:16:07,163 --> 01:16:09,131
but if Laputa
really has such great power,

831
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:13,030
we can't let it fall into the hands
of bad people like Muska.

832
01:16:13,202 --> 01:16:15,227
And,

833
01:16:15,604 --> 01:16:18,164
if we run away now,
Muska is gonna chase us forever.

834
01:16:18,340 --> 01:16:21,241
But Pazu, I don't want you
to become a pirate because of me.

835
01:16:22,044 --> 01:16:23,978
I'm not gonna become a pirate.

836
01:16:24,213 --> 01:16:26,079
PAZU: Don't worry,
Dola will understand.

837
01:16:26,248 --> 01:16:28,307
She's much nicer
than she pretends to be.

838
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:32,552
And when we've finally found it,
I promise you we'll go back to Gondoa.

839
01:16:32,721 --> 01:16:34,587
I want to see it all, Sheeta.

840
01:16:34,757 --> 01:16:37,590
The old house where you were born,
the valley, and everything.

841
01:16:37,760 --> 01:16:40,127
SHEETA: Oh, Pazu.

842
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:43,061
PAZU: Sheeta, what's that?

843
01:16:43,299 --> 01:16:45,267
Right there, under the ship. See it?

844
01:16:53,109 --> 01:16:55,077
Captain!
It's Goliath, right under our bow!

845
01:17:00,249 --> 01:17:02,183
Starboard rudder, full speed ahead!

846
01:17:32,248 --> 01:17:35,343
Why don't you go after them,
Muska? Get them!

847
01:17:35,718 --> 01:17:38,050
It's useless to look for them
in the cloud cover.

848
01:17:38,687 --> 01:17:41,384
I don't need to waste my energy
on a wild goose chase.

849
01:17:42,191 --> 01:17:44,683
Besides, we're running
right on schedule.

850
01:17:56,839 --> 01:17:59,308
It was farther north than I figured.

851
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,643
Pazu, listen carefully to me.

852
01:18:01,810 --> 01:18:04,802
DOLA: Everything will be ruined
if we lose track of Goliath.

853
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:07,711
You've got good eyes. I want you
to watch her and keep us on course.

854
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:08,873
How do I do that, Captain?

855
01:18:09,251 --> 01:18:12,346
The crow's-nest can be made into a kite.
See the metal handle on the bulkhead?

856
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:15,654
-Igotit.
-Turn it clockwise.

857
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:21,755
DOLA: Hook it up. And then turn
the handle, that'll make the wings open.

858
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:27,329
Now extend the wire.

859
01:18:27,703 --> 01:18:30,138
You have to get the hang of flying it
on your own!

860
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:33,206
- Are you up there, Sheeta, my dear?
-Yes.

861
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:36,310
- Best you come down right now.
-Why?

862
01:18:36,478 --> 01:18:39,072
Because you're a girl! A female!
That's man's work!

863
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,216
But you're female, Captain.

864
01:18:41,383 --> 01:18:43,351
I grew up in the mountains,
I can do this.

865
01:18:43,719 --> 01:18:47,678
- Sheeta, no!
- Be quiet. And Pazu agrees with me.

866
01:18:48,257 --> 01:18:51,227
{LAUGHING} All right, me hearty.

867
01:18:51,393 --> 01:18:54,419
Once you take off, you'll have
to use the phone to communicate.

868
01:18:54,797 --> 01:18:55,821
(RINGING)

869
01:18:55,998 --> 01:18:59,093
- SHEETA: You mean this phone?
- She is good.

870
01:18:59,268 --> 01:19:02,101
Right. I think we're set.
Ready for takeoff.

871
01:19:02,271 --> 01:19:04,740
DOLA: Aye-aye, anchor's away.

872
01:19:23,225 --> 01:19:24,784
I don't see them.

873
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,450
They must be hiding
under the cloud cover.

874
01:19:26,829 --> 01:19:29,457
DOLA: Perhaps,
but they could also be above you.

875
01:19:29,832 --> 01:19:31,766
- Keep your eyes peeled.
- Roger.

DOLA: What happened?
PAZU: Nothing, just a gust of wind.

880
01:19:45,314 --> 01:19:47,248
Didn't bother us at all.

881
01:19:48,417 --> 01:19:51,182
We're fine.
We'll keep on watching.

882
01:19:51,353 --> 01:19:53,344
- Afraid?
- Uh-uh.

883

Storm ahead.

884
01:20:00,396 --> 01:20:03,331
Sheeta, look in my bag.
There should be some rope in there.

885
01:20:03,499 --> 01:20:05,399
- Okay.
- Let's tie ourselves together.

886
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,934
-This storm is gonna be rough.
- Good idea.

887
01:20:11,006 --> 01:20:13,475
The mercury is dropping
really fast, Mom.

888
01:20:13,842 --> 01:20:17,301
Blast our luck, boys.What a rotten time
for a storm. When is sun-up?

889
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,913
In one hour.

PAZU: Wait a minute,
something's not right.

892
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:40,436
The sun is coming up in the
wrong place. We're out of position.

893
01:20:40,602 --> 01:20:42,434
You're right. We're supposed to be
heading east, not north.

894
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:44,333
We're going the wrong way! Captain!

895
01:20:44,973 --> 01:20:46,839
Huh? What do you mean,
we're headed north?

896
01:20:47,009 --> 01:20:49,273
But the compass needle
is pointing east, Mom.

897
01:20:49,445 --> 01:20:50,935
There's something
confusing the compass,

898
01:20:51,113 --> 01:20:52,410
and I want to know what itis.

899

- SHEETA: There it is. Look!
-There what is? Is it Goliath?

900

PAZU: No, it's a cloud.
And I've only seen one other like it.

901
01:20:59,488 --> 01:21:00,546
A cloud?

902
01:21:01,056 --> 01:21:02,820
It's heading right for us!

903
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:17,600
That's it...

904
01:21:17,973 --> 01:21:20,408
I'm not gonna captain my ship
into the eye of a hurricane.

Pull back! Pull back, I tell you!
All engines reverse!

906
01:21:42,030 --> 01:21:43,896
We're being pulled
into the center of the storm.

DOLA: Sorry, Pazu, we can't help you,
you have to ride it out.

Wow.

It's just like Dad said, two winds
blowing in opposite directions.

Shiver me timbers,
what a powerful storm!

Mom, it's no use, we'll be sucked in!

it's a quitter!

- PAZU: Captain, Laputa's in there!
- Laputa's where?

922
01:23:01,009 --> 01:23:02,704
This is just the kind of storm
my father saw,

923
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:04,409
and Laputa's in the middle of it.

924
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:08,075
DOLA: It can't be.
It'd be smashed to pieces!

- Pazu! Look there!
- Huh?

926
01:23:13,522 --> 01:23:18,084
My boys, we have a dilemma.
It's Goliath off the port bow!

927
01:23:26,768 --> 01:23:28,702
We're gonna go into the hurricane.

928
01:23:29,071 --> 01:23:31,199
My dad made it through alive,
and so will we.

929

Ready? Brace yourselves, gentlemen!

930
01:23:46,522 --> 01:23:48,650
We did it! Got 'em!

931
01:23:49,024 --> 01:23:51,220
If we don't turn, we'll hit that storm.

- All ahead, full.
- Sir?

933

The light is pointing
to the center of the whirlwind.

934
01:23:57,666 --> 01:24:01,034
Laputa is in that storm.
I won't retreat.

935
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:04,639
Now go straight ahead.
And that is an order, Captain.

My eyes! I can't see!

No! No!

1255
01:56:11,097 --> 01:56:15,432
-We can't wait anymore, Mom!
- All right, then, let's shove off!

1256
01:56:15,735 --> 01:56:17,669
Hurry up!

1257
01:56:28,482 --> 01:56:31,417
Look at that,
the whole thing's collapsing!

Poor kids. I'll really miss them.

1259
01:57:24,638 --> 01:57:27,073
They used the spell of destruction.

1260
01:57:27,240 --> 01:57:30,608
They saved Laputa
from the evil hands of Muska.

Mother, look! What is that
big blue light up there?

1263
01:57:45,659 --> 01:57:47,252
It's a big stone.

1264
01:57:53,600 --> 01:57:56,433
That tree's getting away
with our treasure.

Pazu?

Looks like these roots saved us.

It looks fine. It should work.

- Ready?
- Ready.

1272

Now!

What's going on here?
It's getting away from us!

Why the deuce
aren't we gaining altitude?

There's just
too much weight to gain alt...

So are you. This is great!

No, it's not! My poor little ship
is gone forever! (SOBS)

1282

Stop with the crying, you big baby.
I'll get you another ship!

1283
02:00:50,910 --> 02:00:55,347
Poor little thing, nothing worse
than having your pigtails shot off.

1284

What have you got under there?

My fault. You must have hurt
yourself on these.

Now how'd they get inside my blouse?

1287

All good pirates listen to their mom.
