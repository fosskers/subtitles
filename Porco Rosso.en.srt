00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,189
Mmm-hmm. Mmm-hmm.

168
00:13:21,367 --> 00:13:24,029
We're even getting along with the pig.
Aren't we?

169
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:26,103
- Mmm-hmm.

171
00:13:28,074 --> 00:13:30,008
Wish me luck.

172
00:13:36,382 --> 00:13:37,816
May I help you?

173
00:13:37,984 --> 00:13:39,145
- Back off, Curtis!
- Heyl

174
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:41,447
Porco, tell me about your rescue.

175
00:13:41,888 --> 00:13:44,323
- Next time, when it's just the two of us.

(CHUCKLES) Eating all alone
up here again?

177
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,933
So, what do you think
of that American flyboy?

178
00:13:58,104 --> 00:13:59,094
He's something else, isn't he?

179
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:02,836
As soon as he saw me,
he asked me to marry him.

180
00:14:03,009 --> 00:14:05,205
So I told him of the three pilots I've married,

181
00:14:05,378 --> 00:14:08,370
the first died in the war,
the second died in the Atlantic,

182
00:14:08,548 --> 00:14:11,518
the last one, he died in Asia.

183
00:14:13,453 --> 00:14:14,978
So you've heard something.

184
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:17,922
I got the call last night.

185
00:14:18,091 --> 00:14:21,083
They found his remains
in some remote part of Bengal.

186
00:14:21,561 --> 00:14:23,325
It's strange, Marco.

187
00:14:23,496 --> 00:14:27,433
I've been waiting to hear something for
three years, but now I can't even cry.

188
00:14:28,334 --> 00:14:31,964
I just feel numb.
Maybe I've run out of tears.

189
00:14:33,239 --> 00:14:36,004
Yeah, well, the good guys always die.

190
00:14:36,175 --> 00:14:38,303
Cheers. To a good man.

191
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:41,937
Marco, I want to thank you
for keeping an eye on me

192
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:46,078
and my restaurant all these years.

193
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,956
I just can't tell you
how much your friendship means to me.

194
00:14:53,426 --> 00:14:55,121
Well, you know, it's a great place,

195
00:14:55,294 --> 00:14:58,286
except for that ugly photograph
you keep hanging on the wall up there.

196
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:01,432
GINA: Hey, that's my favorite picture.

197
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:04,127
I can't believe
you scribbled over your face.

198
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,068
That's the only picture
left of you as a human.

199
00:15:08,174 --> 00:15:12,304
How are you ever going to break
that stupid curse on you, Marco?

200
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:16,172
PORCO: Face it. I'm a pig.

201
00:15:32,365 --> 00:15:35,300

BANKER: Yes, ma'am.

206

I envy you, Mr. Rosso. I wish
I could make money the way you do.

207
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:10,461
Here's this month's payment.

208
00:16:10,636 --> 00:16:13,298
That's the last you owe on the seaplane.

209
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:14,463
Let's see.

210
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:18,406
Uh, how about buying some patriotic
bonds, to help serve our nation?

211
00:16:18,578 --> 00:16:21,411
Sorry, I'm a pig.
I'll leave that to you humans.

Hey, there, Mr. Rosso.
We've got your gun ready.

215
00:16:41,267 --> 00:16:43,565
- Give me some ammo, too, kid.
-Yes, sir.

216
00:16:45,505 --> 00:16:47,303
Alot of commotion in the streets.

217
00:16:47,473 --> 00:16:52,206
Sure is. Looks like our islands
are in for a change of government.

218
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:55,075
If so, you bounty hunters
will soon be outlaws.

219
00:16:55,448 --> 00:16:57,382
Laws don't mean anything to a pig.

220

(LAUGHS)

221
00:16:58,718 --> 00:17:02,484
That's a good point.They don't mean
much to us weapons dealers either.

222
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:06,118
Here are the bullets.
Are you sure you want the usual?

223
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:08,488
We've got new armor-piercing ones
that explode on contact.

224
00:17:08,661 --> 00:17:12,655
Hey. Easy, kid, I'm just a bounty hunter.
I'm not fighting a war.

225
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,295
Come again!

226
00:17:17,370 --> 00:17:20,601
So, uh, what's the difference between
fighting a war and bounty hunting?

227
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:23,242
If you make money from war,
you're scum.

228
00:17:23,409 --> 00:17:26,538
But if you can't make money from
bounty hunting, you're an idiot.

we have to work with these losers.

It's the stupid pig's fault, boss.

Look at that. Those Mamma Aiuto guys
can't even afford paint.

fly at least five knots faster.

when I'm out here in my garden,

688

01:00:46,977 --> 01:00:48,274
I followed y'all.

840
01:00:48,645 --> 01:00:51,114
I knew you'd get into trouble without me.

841
01:00:52,749 --> 01:00:53,944
Nice going, Fio.

842
01:00:54,117 --> 01:00:56,609

So you wanna challenge me
to a rematch, do you, pig?

848
01:01:17,274 --> 01:01:18,867
Why should I give it to you?

849
01:01:19,042 --> 01:01:19,907
I won once already,

850
01:01:20,076 --> 01:01:22,238
and my contract with these boys
has expired.

851
01:01:22,445 --> 01:01:25,073
Well, give us a proposition.
What do you want?

852
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,211
Hmm.

853
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:36,791
Beautiful.

854
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,231
Tell you what.
If I win, will you marry me, dading?

856
01:01:44,234 --> 01:01:45,258

Fine with me.

858
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:47,931
But if Porco beats you,

859
01:01:48,104 --> 01:01:50,766
then you have to pay off
the debt he owes me.

860
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:52,269
Don't do it, Fio.

861
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,237

Miss Fio, are you quite certain
you want to do this?

864
01:02:01,318 --> 01:02:02,945
You should ask him, not me.

865
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,053
These bills are kind of expensive.

866
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:06,212
No, they're not.

867
01:02:06,389 --> 01:02:08,323
Are you gonna fight or not?

868
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:11,256
I will gladly fight
for the woman that I love.

869
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:12,759
Good.

The fight will take place

such an honorable thing,

I'm just a stupid little gin.

it doesn't sound so bad.

I guess I was really scared.

902
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:53,161
l just didn't know
if you would fight for me, Porco.

Maybe it was a dream.

PORCO: All middle-aged men are pigs.

925
01:05:50,947 --> 01:05:54,042
You know, I've heard a lot about
Captain Marco Rossellini.

926
01:05:54,384 --> 01:05:56,443
My father was in his fighter unit.

927
01:05:57,387 --> 01:06:00,379
He told me that Marco once
landed his seaplane in a raging sea

928
01:06:00,557 --> 01:06:02,616
to save the life of an enemy pilot.

929
01:06:02,992 --> 01:06:04,687
I think that's amazing.

930
01:06:08,598 --> 01:06:10,930
I got it! What if I kiss you, Porco?

931
01:06:11,501 --> 01:06:12,434
Huh?

932
01:06:12,602 --> 01:06:15,367
Yeah, you've heard of the fairy tale
where the gid kisses the frog

933
01:06:15,538 --> 01:06:17,632
and it turns him back into
a handsome prince.

934
01:06:18,007 --> 01:06:18,701
Come on.

935
01:06:19,075 --> 01:06:20,509
You've gotta save it
for somebody special,

936
01:06:20,677 --> 01:06:22,008

937
01:06:23,546 --> 01:06:25,275
Don't you like me?

01:06:28,384 --> 01:06:30,045
You're a great kid.

01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:31,412
You know what, Fio?

940
01:06:31,588 --> 01:06:34,683
Seeing you makes me wish
I'd never given up being human.

941
01:06:35,058 --> 01:06:36,617
Now go to sleep.

942
01:06:37,460 --> 01:06:40,361
First tell me a story.
Then I'll go to sleep.

(EXHALES DEEPLY)

946
01:06:55,078 --> 01:06:57,513
It was the last summer of the Great War.

947
01:06:59,048 --> 01:07:03,451
We were flying over the Adriatic
on a routine surveillance patrol,

948
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,452
headed toward Istria.

949
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:13,422
My good buddy Berlini was
right beside me.

950
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:18,000
He had just gotten married to Gina
of the Hotel Adriano,

951
01:07:20,403 --> 01:07:21,666
and I was his best man.

952
01:07:23,606 --> 01:07:24,539
But the war called,

953
01:07:24,707 --> 01:07:28,109
so we had to go back into battle
right after the ceremony.

954
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:40,355
Suddenly, we were in the middle
of the worst dogfight of my life.

955
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:51,523
Friends and enemies were falling
all around me like flies.

956
01:07:51,701 --> 01:07:54,432
I had three planes
trying to chase me down,

957
01:07:54,604 --> 01:07:56,800
and all I thought about was myself.

958
01:07:57,173 --> 01:08:00,507
Soon I realized
I was the only one left from my unit.

959
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,171
But the enemy never let up.

960
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,744
I flew my guts out trying to get away.

961
01:08:06,115 --> 01:08:08,140
My hands and feet went numb.

962
01:08:08,384 --> 01:08:10,580
I could feel myself starting to black out.

963
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:11,811
I was sure I was going to die.

964
01:08:12,188 --> 01:08:15,556
Then suddenly,
everything around me turned white.

965
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:16,624
FIO: White?

966
01:08:16,793 --> 01:08:20,161
PORCO: Yeah. It was the strangest
thing I'd ever seen.

967
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:24,295
The light was so pure,
I figured I must be in heaven.

968
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:27,061
Then I realized
I had just flown into a cloud.

969
01:08:27,804 --> 01:08:29,203
I was so exhausted,

970
01:08:29,439 --> 01:08:32,101
I couldn't hold onto the stick
to fly my plane.

971
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,642
But the plane just kept on flying.

972
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,104
It flew by itself?

973
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:04,563
Yeah.

974
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:08,607
It was perfectly quiet,
and the sky was beautiful.

975
01:09:09,545 --> 01:09:13,140
Then I saw this strange band of white
high above me.

976
01:09:41,944 --> 01:09:44,504
Berlini! I thought you were dead!

977
01:09:47,784 --> 01:09:50,776
Come back here!
Where do you think you're going?

978
01:10:03,266 --> 01:10:05,530
What about Gina?
You can't leave her alone.

979
01:10:05,702 --> 01:10:07,227
Let me go instead.

980
01:10:07,537 --> 01:10:08,561
Hold on!

981
01:10:49,011 --> 01:10:52,675
When I came to,
I was skimming just above the sea,

982
01:10:53,282 --> 01:10:54,716
all alone.

983
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:00,621
God was telling you
it wasn't your time yet.

984
01:11:01,023 --> 01:11:02,457
You think?

985
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:04,593
Seems to me
he was telling me I was a pig

986
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:06,957
and maybe I deserved to be all alone.

987
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,799
You can't believe that.
You're a good person.

988
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,825
No, the good guys were
the ones who died.

989
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,230
Or maybe I'm dead

990
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:17,805
and life as a pig is
the same thing as hell.

991
01:11:18,574 --> 01:11:19,837
Now go to sleep.

992
01:11:21,377 --> 01:11:24,745
That stupid kid,
he sold me rusted cartridges.

993
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,282
I think you're
a great human being, Porco.

994
01:11:29,652 --> 01:11:31,814
And I'm glad you're still around.

995
01:11:33,289 --> 01:11:34,620
Good night!

996
01:11:58,014 --> 01:11:59,812
Hurry and place your bets.
Don't miss out on the action.

997
01:11:59,982 --> 01:12:02,007
The odds are eight to seven, Curtis
over Porco, that's eight to seven.

998
01:12:02,385 --> 01:12:05,616
I've got two box seats left, two seats.
And three in the bleachers.

999
01:12:05,788 --> 01:12:07,916
Come on, get your ice cream.

1000
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:13,394
MAN 1: A hundred on the plane.
WOMAN: That's what we pledge?

1001
01:12:13,629 --> 01:12:15,723
MAN 2: Too many people here.

1002
01:12:15,898 --> 01:12:18,868
Bunch of morons.
They're turning this into a big party.

1003
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:21,060
Are all these people here air pirates?

1004
01:12:21,437 --> 01:12:23,838
No, you've got trash
from all over the Mediterranean.

1005
01:12:24,006 --> 01:12:25,804
Gangsters, smugglers, gamblers.

1006
01:12:25,975 --> 01:12:29,741
Yeah, you might have a handful
of respectable people, but I doubt it.

1007
01:12:30,646 --> 01:12:33,775
Wow, not only do I get a wife,
I'll be getting even more famous.

1008
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:37,748
Ten minutes to start.
Ten minutes to start.

1009
01:12:38,120 --> 01:12:39,315
Listen up!

1010
01:12:39,488 --> 01:12:43,618
This is a fight of honor between
Porco Rosso and Donald Curtis,

1011
01:12:43,893 --> 01:12:46,055
so if one of you fights dirty,

1012
01:12:46,429 --> 01:12:50,093
you'll be disrespected
by seaplane pilots for eternity.

it was time to go back to Milan.

still hang out at Gina's bar.

President of the United States.
